abstract={We have measured sound levels from frog choruses in eastern New York State at altitudes of up to several hundred metres. Rana pipiens choruses from small ponds often could be recorded by a radio microphone up to 500 m, and on an especially favourable night with light winds they were clearly audible even at 965 m at about 20 dB SPL in the 1·5 to 2·5 2·5 kHz frequency band. Sound travels upward much farther and more predictably than along the surface. Many natural sounds, including those from frogs, insects, whitecaps, and perhaps wind-blown vegetation, arise from large areas and therefore act as extended sources. The intensities of such sounds decrease with altitude more slowly than expected from the inverse square law. Natural sound fields provide migrating birds with a potential source of information about the kind of land or water below them, and their progress over acoustic landmarks could inform them about wind velocity. Because atmospheric absorption increases with frequency, several hundred metres of air act as a low-pass filter, so that altitude could be estimated from the relative reduction of higher frequencies in a familiar sound. © 1974.},

abstract={During 1980, a radiotelemetry study on barn owls (Tyto alba) was conducted to evaluate the secondary hazards of the anticoagulant rodenticide TALON® (containing 0.005% brodifacoum) when it was used for controlling rats (Rattus spp.) and house mice (Mus musculus) on farms. Thirty‐five active nests were located in about 1,100 km2 (430 mi2) in southwestern New Jersey. Starting on June 9, 1980, radio transmitters with tail clips were attached to 26 adult nesting barn owls and 8 fledged young of the year. In one 20‐km2 (about 8 mi2) area, which was the most intensively searched, 12 active barn owl nests were located. Of all 35 active nests, 66% were in trees, 11% in barns, 8.5% in silos, 8.5% in chimneys and 6% in miscellaneous locations. Analysis of regurgitated pellets showed that meadow voles (Microtus pennsylvanicus) were the most common prey at all sites. Although Norway rats (Rattus norvegicus) and house mice occurred in some pellet collections, they made up only a small part of the diet (3.9% rats and 2% mice) of barn owls in the study area. Baiting at farms with TALON was begun on July 24, and ended on September 29, 1980. TALON was not observed to cause or implicated in barn owl mortality during the study. However, trace residues (&lt; 0.05 ppm, the limit of determination) of brodifacoum were found in one electrocuted barn owl. Young barn owls were fledged from at least eight sites where poisoned rodents were available on the farms for at least part of the nesting and feeding period (including pre‐ and postfledging). Furthermore, radiotelemetry confirmed that at least 9, and possibly 12, of the radio‐equipped owls were present on sites posttreatment, when census evaluations showed commensal rodents were present and consuming TALON bait.

abstract={Using the wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) as an example of a typical nocturnal migrant, we employed radio telemetry to follow breeding birds during the course of homing movements following displacements. Seven thrushes were displaced over distances of 6.5 to 17.3 km in a variety of directions from their nesting territories. The thrushes moved in a series of short flights (mean = 2.1 km) performed primarily at dawn. Consequently, the birds took several days to home from even these relatively short displacements. Thrushes flew under clear and solid overcast skies and even in light rain. The pooled individual flights of the birds were significantly oriented in the homeward direction (Fig. 2). Their orientation relative to home did not improve significantly as they progressed toward the goal. Three of the birds were documented to have returned to their home territories. The detailed tracks of the birds preclude the possibility that they homed by random search. © 1984 Springer-Verlag.},

Spontaneous heart rate fluctuations in response to stressors involved in management‐related activities, as well as some in response to naturally occurring activities, were recorded. In nearly every case, stressors caused dramatic increases in the heart rate of each bird, the magnitude of which was directly related to the degree of human contact involved. The increased heart rates occurred in response to stressors whether or not any behavioral stress symptoms were exhibited.

abstract={Immunoblots of interphotoreceptor matrix preparations from 20 species belonging to six vertebrate classes were probed with antibodies against bovine interstitial retinol‐binding protein (b‐IRBP). Each preparation displayed an immunoreactive protein band. In the Osteichthyes, the apparent Mr of this band was 67,600 ± 2,700 (x̄ ± SD, n = 8). In two of the Osteichthyes, the band was resolved into a closely spaced doublet. Including previously published data for five mammals and one amphibian, species from the other classes (Chondrichthyes, one species; Amphibia, four species; Reptilia, one species; Aves, one species; Mammalia, nine species) had IRBPs with Mr that averaged 2.0 times that of the Osteichthyes, namely 134,200 ± 8,600 (x̄ ± SD, n = 17). Frog IRBP was very similar to mammalian IRBP in terms of its immunohistochemical distribution (determined with rabbit anti‐frog IRBP antibodies), its molecular weight (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gel‐filtration chromatography), retinol‐ and concanavalin A‐binding ability, and because it was synthesized and secreted in vitro by the isolated retina but not by the pigmented layers of eye. Goldfish IRBP apparently binds exogenous (3H)‐retinol but does not bind concanavalin A and has about half the Mr of frog IRBP. The occurrence of IRBP‐like proteins crossreacting with anti b‐IRBP antibodies in the interphotoreceptor matrix of all six major vertebrate classes is consistent with the hypothesis that IRBP is an important element in the vertebrate visual cycle.

abstract={During the fall and winter of 1981–82, a study was conducted to evaluate the secondary poisoning hazards associated with a proposed anticoagulant rodenticide, Volid® (10 ppm brodifacoum), when used to control voles (Microtus spp.) in apple orchards. Radio transmitters were attached to 38 eastern screech‐owls (Otus asio), 5 barred owls (Strix varia), 3 red‐tailed hawks (Buteo jamaicensis), 2 great horned owls (Bubo virginianus) and 2 long‐eared owls (Asio otus), and the birds' movements were monitored before, during, and after rodenticide applications. Screech‐owls selected woods over alternate habitats for day‐roosting; 73% of daytime locations were in woods. At night, screech‐owls generally were located in woods, orchard, and field‐pasture proportional to their availability, while they avoided cropland. The home ranges of 32 screech‐owls tracked posttreatment included brodifacoum‐treated areas; the proportion of home range treated and habitat use varied among individuals. Minimum mortality was 58% among screech‐owls for which more than 20% of home range was treated, as compared with 17% among those for which less than 10% of home range was treated. Secondary brodifacoum poisoning was the most probable cause of death in six screech‐owls. Of five other screech‐owls found dead posttreatment, four had been consumed by predators and one died of unknown causes. Of six radio‐equipped screech‐owls collected one to two months posttreatment, four contained detectable brodifacoum residue. The fate of 14 of the 32 screech‐owls tracked posttreatment was unknown at the conclusion of radiotracking efforts (63 d after treatment began) because radio contact was lost or the transmitter was dropped; one of these owls was encountered alive in May. Four barred owls tracked posttreatment showed strong selection for woodland habitat and used orchards limitedly; none was found dead posttreatment. One long‐eared owl found dead (not radio‐equipped) was probably killed by secondary brodifacoum poisoning. The results indicate a hazard to screech‐owls and a potential risk to other raptors, given this use pattern and formulation of brodifacoum bait. Copyright © 1988 SETAC},

abstract={Prior to a limited field application of an orally-administered vaccinia-rabies glycoprotein (V-RG) recombinant virus vaccine for wildlife, background data were obtained for the proposed site on Parramore Island, Virginia (USA). Mammalian target and nontarget species, potentially at risk for exposure to vaccine were inventoried. Placebo baiting trials with a fishmeal polymer bait resulted in high bait disturbance (88 to 100%), primarily by raccoons (Procyon lotor), with infrequent visitation and no evidence of bait consumption by deer (Odocoileus virginianus), small mammals or avian species. Definitive bait acceptance rates by raccoons (indicative of bait ingestion) were difficult to accurately determine based exclusively on premolar and vibrissae samples collected antemortem from live-trapped raccoons for tetracycline and rhodamine B biomarker analyses, respectively. Bait acceptance rate was more accurately determined during a pilot baiting trial conducted on North Island, South Carolina, when mandibles (postmortem samples) were examined for tetracycline incorporation. Parasitologic findings in raccoons on Parramore Island included Hepatozoan procyonis, Phagicola angrense and Physaloptera rara and a variety of incidental microscopic lesions, and provided baseline pathological data for comparison subsequent to V-RG vaccine application. A population density estimate of one raccoon/2.7 ha was calculated using mark-recapture data for comparison after vaccine deployment. Limited reproductive data, including estimates of pregnancy rates by palpation, the number of live kits/litter live-trapped with previously pregnant raccoons or observed in the dens of radio-collared raccoons, was gathered to assess the effect of proposed oral vaccination with V-RG vaccine. Home ranges were assessed by radio-telemetry of 15 raccoons; all radio-collared raccoons currently reside on Parramore Island.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

The frequency of lizards found with broken tails on the butte was also significantly higher for individuals with lighter dorsal markings. Lighter-marked lizards found on the mesa suffered a significantly lower frequency of tail breaks.

abstract={We have examined the distribution in Xenopus embryos of β1 subunits of integrin, as recognized by cross‐reactive antibodies against the avian integrin beta1 subunit. These antibodies recognize a doublet of bands of approximately 120 kD in Xenopus embryos. The distribution pattern of these integrin cell surface receptors was compared with that of two possible ligands, fibronectin and laminin, in the extracellular matrix during the time of neural crest cell migration. Integrin immunoreactivity in the early neurula was observed lightly outlining somite and epidermal cells and the notochord. The integrin immunostaining increased with developmental age and was observed on most cell types in the embryo but was particularly notable in the intersomitic clefts through which motoraxons grow. The immunoreactivity in this region was not, however, wholly on the axon surfaces, since intersomitic integrin remained detectable in embryos in which the neural tube had been ablated. Fibronectin and laminin were more extensively distributed than integrin at all stages examined. Immunoreactivity for both was observed around the neural tube, notochord, somites, epidermis, dorsal mesentery, and lateral plate mesoderm. The distribution of laminin and fibronectin around the somites was particularly interesting since it was non‐uniform and similar to that of integrin. Strongest staining was observed in the intersomitic clefts, and weakest staining was observed on the medial surface of the somites, which faces the neural tube and notochord. The major differences in distribution pattern between the fibronectin and laminin immunoreactivities were that only fibronectin was detected in the mesenchyme of the dorsal fin. Our results demonstrate that a molecule homologous to avian integrin is present in Xenopus embryos during neural crest cell migration and motoraxon outgrowth. Its presence in the intersomitic clefts and on the surface of many embryonic cell types together with the abundant distribution of its ligands are consistent with a potentially important developmental function in neurite outgrowth and/or muscle development.

abstract={Habitat use and foraging behaviour of resident merlins Falco columbarius wintering in Saskatoon, Canada, were studied over a five‐year period. Birds were trapped through the winter and selected individuals fitted with radio transmitters to monitor continously their location, movements and activities from roost departure until re‐entry. Merlins maintained individual home ranges in winter, with extensive overlap between neighbouring birds in some cases. Yearling home ranges were not significantly different in size from those of adults. The winter home ranges of adults were closely associated with their previous nest site. Both adults and yearlings made significantly greater use of Residential habitat in the city than expected based on the area available in their home ranges. However, while adults remained largely in the two oldest habitat types, yearlings were also found in more recently built areas of the city. Home ranges held within the city were sometimes combined with foraging areas in the adjacent countryside. The use of foraging areas in farmyards and cattle feedlots outside of the city was most notable in adults, although some yearlings apparently learned this strategy in their first year. Merlins also used Commercial‐Industrial habitat for hunting at levels much higher than expected from its availability in their home ranges. Diets in summer and winter had a high degree of overlap; house sparrows Passer domesticus and bohemian waxwings Bombycilla garrulus made up a large proportion of the diet during both seasons. Hunting activity peaked at 09:00 and 16:00 h, reflecting the replenishment of energy stores lost over‐night, and the storage of energy in preparation for the next over‐night fast.

abstract={Four phenotypic attributes of male zebra finches were investigated to determine if observed variability predicts relatedness. Traits studied included three secondary sexual traits (bill colour, breast band and throat stripes), and one species-specific character (eye stripes). To score similarities, two series of pairs were created, with half of all pairs containing same-clutch siblings, the other half non-siblings (r≤1/8). Sibling were found to be more similar than non-siblings with respect to eye and throat stripe attributes, but not with regard to breast band size and bill colour. A human observer predicted which sets contained siblings with considerable accuracy. Results suggest that family resemblances for some visual traits are sufficiently great that they could be used by zebra finches in the process of phenotype matching. In birds, visual similarities may be more reliable indicators of relatedness than auditory similarities, due to the important role of learning in the acquisition of bird song. © 1990 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

Forty-six of 73 blood-engorged larvae and 50 of 66 fully-fed nymphs, removed from wild-caught birds, successfully molted. Borreliae were isolated from 21 of 78 partially- and fully-fed larvae off birds, including six specimens that molted. Spirochete-positive cultures also were obtained from 35 of 60 partially- and fully-fed nymphs that had fed from birds, including 20 nymphs that molted into adult ticks. Transstadially passed borreliae by bird-feeding larval and nymphal I. dammini were infectious to hamsters, leading us to suggest that these ticks are capable of subsequently transmitting infectious spirochetes to mammals, including humans. An isolated of B. burgdorferi, recovered from a bird-feeding larval Ixodes dentatus, was indistinguishable by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis from the B31 strain. This isolate, unlike another from I. dentatus off a cottontail rabbit (Sylvilagus floridanus), had a protein band with a molecular weight of approximately 31,000 that reacted with murine monoclonal antibodies H3TS and H5332 in western blot analysis. Thus, closely related borreliae are present in both I. dentatus and I. dammini.},

abstract={Free‐living female red‐winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus) were captured on their nests and given oral doses of 0, 2.37 or 4.21 mg/kg methyl parathion in a propylene glycol carrier during incubation. Birds were released immediately after dosing and observed for 5 h to document behavioral effects, amount of time spent off the nest after dosing and time spent incubating. Each nest was monitored until nestlings fledged or until all nestlings died or disappeared. For each nest, the time of abandonment, hatching success and fledging success were determined. In addition, prefledging weights were obtained for all nestlings in nests at 8 d after hatch. Although methyl parathion caused ataxia, lacrimation and lethargy and significantly depressed cholinesterase activity (>35%) at 4.21 mg/kg, there were no apparent adverse effects on reproduction. Females receiving 4.21 mg/kg methyl parathion were able to return to their nests, resume incubation, successfully hatch their clutch and rear their young. Nestlings of poisoned females did not have significantly different body weights at 8 d compared to controls, indicating that methyl parathion did not disrupt the females' ability to forage and deliver adequate food to nestlings. Band returns from the following year indicated that treatment birds returned and nested in nearly the same proportion as did controls and other red‐winged blackbirds occupying the ponds. There was no indication that a single oral dose of methyl parathion (2.37 or 4.21 mg/kg) decreased over‐winter survival. Copyright © 1990 SETAC},

They received either all red bands (to match their epaulets) or all black bands (controls). Over half the red-banded males lost their territories while all black-banded males retained their territories. Red and black-banded males did not differ morphologically. However, among red-banded males, those that lost their territories had larger epaulets and were in poorer condition than those retaining their territories. Red-banded males suffered much higher intrusion rates, particularly by neighbors, than black-banded males. We propose that red color bands exaggerated the males' natural aggressive signal beyond the point where the signal was reliable. Our results suggest that signal reliability is maintained by regular testing, particularly of those males most likely to be signalling dishonestly. © 1991 Springer-Verlag.},

Bobwhites receiving 6 mg/kg methyl parathion had lower survival (P = 0.022) than control birds due to predation, not overt toxicity. There were no differences (P > 0.05) among treatment groups in activity, but methyl parathion may have influenced covey integrity. Birds that survived methyl parathion treatment had brain cholinesterase activities similar to those of control bobwhites. The results suggest that if bobwhites receive sufficiently high methyl parathion exposure in their natural habitats, then their susceptibility to predation may increase. Copyright © 1991 SETAC},

abstract={We studied prey populations and the use and composition of home ranges of 47 Northern Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) over 12 mo in five landscapes in two forest types in southwestern Oregon. We measured 1-yr home ranges of 23 owl pairs, 2-yr home ranges of 13 pairs, and 3-yr home ranges of 3 pairs. The landscapes differed in the degree to which old forest had been fragmented by wildfire and logging. Prey populations were measured at 47 sites in southwestern Oregon. Further data on prey populations were gathered on 14 sites on the Olympic Peninsula in northern Washington, where owls use larger ranges than in Oregon. Owls in Washington used ≈ 1700 ha of old forest annually and primarily one prey species; available prey biomass was 61 g/ha. Owls in Oregon Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests used 813 ± 133 ha (X̄ ± SE) of old forest annually and concentrated on two prey species that had a combined biomass of 244 g/ha. Owls in Oregon mixed-conifer forest used 454 ± 84 ha of old forest annually and three primary prey whose availability averaged 338 g/ha. The amount of old forest used by owls studied for 2 yr was 40% greater in the 2nd yr than that used in the 1 st yr. No increase in use of old forest was seen in the 3rd yr in Douglas-fir forest; 50% more old forest was used in 3 yr than in the 1st yr in mixed-conifer forest. The most common prey in Washington and Oregon was the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus). In areas where the flying squirrel was the primary prey and where predation was intense (as judged by telemetry), flying squirrel populations were depressed. The addition of medium-sized mammal species, especially woodrats (Neotoma spp.), to the prey base appeared to reduce markedly the amount of old forest used for foraging. Owls traversed 85% more Douglas-fir forest and 3 times more mixed-conifer forest in the heavily fragmented areas than in the lightly fragmented areas. Overlap among pairs and separation of birds within pairs in space increased with fragmentation. In the most heavily fragmented landscape, social structure appeared to be abnormal, as judged by the proportion of adult-subadult pairs, instances of adult nomadism, and overlap among the home ranges of pairs. The pattern of fragmentation affected the ability of owls to find concentrations of old forest in the landscapes. Even so, almost all the owls consistently selected old forests for foraging and roosting; only one owl selected a younger type as part of its foraging range. Selection of old forest was significant at three levels: landscape, annual home ranges of pairs, and foraging and roosting sites of individuals. The most important prey species, the northern flying squirrel, was twice as abundant in old forest as in young forest in all areas. Landscape indices (dominance, contagion, variance in density of old forest) had less predictive ability than indices based on owl home ranges because owls selected areas of concentrated old forest and because patterning was complex, reflecting four processes, each operating at a different scale: physiography, human land ownership (259-ha scale), history of catastrophic fires, and history of small-scale fires and timber harvesting.},

Most larvae emerge from sediments during the summer, but a smaller component of the larval population on a Delaware Bay beach can delay emergence, and remain alive within the sediments until the following spring. Overwintering trilobites were distributed in a 3m wide band in the mid-tide region, at sediment depths &gt;15cm. 103 to 104 live trilobites m-2 have been found throughout winter and into early spring. This phenomenon may be ecologically signficant, since emergence of overwintering larvae in early spring occurs at a time when predation by birds is minimal. Sediment disturbance by winter storms may be the major factor limiting survivorship of overwintering cohorts. -Authors},

abstract={Brace® 10G (a.i. isazofos), an organophosphorus insecticide being tested for potential registration for control of various corn pests, was applied to 14 Iowa cornfields in an 18‐cm band at planting at 0.73 kg a.i. per hectare. Effects of isazofos on wildlife were evaluated by searching treated fields and adjacent areas for carcasses and monitoring survival of radiomarked northern bob‐white and ground‐foraging passerines. Fifty carcasses (26 birds, 21 mammals, three herps) were recovered following application. Four of the bird and 12 of the mammal carcasses found postapplication had tissues suitable for residue analysis but did not contain detectable isazofos residues. Brain cho‐linesterase (ChE) activities measured in four bird and seven small mammal carcasses were not depressed in relation to reference values. Two radiomarked bobwhite died before application, and two radiomarked bobwhite and three radiomarked passerines died following applications. Three of these birds had sufficient tissues for residue analysis, but none had detectable isazofos residues or brain ChE depression relative to reference values, and pre‐ and postapplication mortality rates of radio‐marked birds were not significantly different.

Thirty-four eggs of migratory greater sandhill cranes (GSHC) (G. canadensis tabida) were exchanged for the clutches in 23 nests of Florida sandhill cranes (FSHC) (G.c. pratensis), a non-migratory subspecies; five young were fledged from these introductions. Concurrently, 27 captive-reared, subadult GSHC were soft-released in the same area of N-central Florida. Movements and survival of both release groups were assessed through radio telemetry. In general, dispersal was similar to normal, subadult FSHC. The experimental birds tended to move south in autumn, but did not move north in the spring; frequency of southern movements was not different in control and experimental groups. Survival differed between experimental groups; 56% for captive-reared young (for the first year following release) and 39% for foster-reared young (from hatching to leaving natal home range). Thus, captive-rearing and soft-release should be used as the primary reintroduction strategy for future releases. -from Authors},

abstract={The purpose of this study was to determine if common poorwills (Phalaenoptilus nuttallii) resist entering torpor during the breeding season. During the summers of 1991 and 1992, we studied poorwills in the Cypress Hills, Saskatchewan, Canada, near the northern limit of their distribution. Since poorwills are monogamous and share incubating and brooding responsibilities, we predicted that the non‐incubating or non‐brooding bird would enter torpor when stressed energetically (e.g. on cold and/or wet nights). Individuals carrying temperature‐sensitive radio transmitters entered torpor significantly less often during the breeding season (two of 195 bird nights) than the non‐breeding season (27 of 44 bird nights). During the breeding season we found no birds involved in an active nesting attempt in torpor. We conclude that reproduction constrains the use of torpor by adult birds, but why non‐incubating and non‐breeding birds did not enter remains unclear. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

abstract={We documented habitat use by the Resplendent Quetzal Pharomacrus mocinno, a large frugivorous bird that breeds in cloud-forests in the highlands of Central America, to assess the adequacy of protection afforded to regional biodiversity by the Monteverde reserve complex, a protected natural area that includes most of the highland forests of the Tilarán mountain range in western Costa Rica. Our results demonstrated that this relatively large (20,000 ha) protected natural area does not adequately protect the area's biodiversity. Through the use of radio-telemetry, we identified the areas on the Pacific slopes that are most critical to altirudinally migrating Quetzals. These forest patches are subject to deforestation and degradation and are rapidly becoming further isolated from other remaining forest. The possibility of the local extirpation of the Quetzal, through continued habitat loss on the Pacific slopes, presents an unusual dilemma for the region because the species is the major attraction for the Ideal tourist industry which now includes over 80 businesses and annually generates over US$5 million in local revenue. Therefore, its extirpation would seriously affect regional economic stability. In order to protect the Monteverde Quetzal population, we propose a regional conservation plan that depends on participation of local landowners to protect their remaining forest fragments and allows for the development of corridors to connect critical habitats as the focus of a regional conservation effort. While the ecological significance of the structure of corridors per se, versus other possible formats, is still being debated, we have selected the corridor format primarily because it is relatively easy for landowners to grasp the concept and the necessity for continuity of the corridor network. This recognition provides an important incentive for participation across property boundaries, promoting cooperation in a group effort rather than as isolated actions. Success of this cooperative plan will provide an example for grass-roots participation in buffer-zone management strategies elsewhere in the Neotropics. © 1994, Birdlife International.

In this population, breeding pairs may or may not have helpers, most of which are males that remain on their natal territory. Our sample included helpers assisting their parents, helpers assisting a related male and an unrelated female, and helpers assisting an unrelated pair. Band by band comparison and examination of similarity among DNA profiles indicated that all offspring from non-helped nests were sired by their putative parents (n = 28 families). Similarly, all but one offspring in helped nests were also sired by their putative parents (n = 16 families). In the exceptional case, the offspring evidently was sired by a male external to the group. Analysis of similarity values supported the conclusion that matings by helpers or extra-group males are rare or non-existent. Our results indicate that in this species advantages gained by individuals remaining on their natal territories as helpers do not generally include siring offspring. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Accurate estimates of male reproductive success are essential to understanding the evolution of polyandrous mating systems. Here, we use multilocus DNA fingerpinting to assess parentage in an island population of Tasmanian native hens (Tribonyx mortierii), which often live in multi-male and/or multi-female social groups. This isolated population presented special challenges to this technique because it was artificially founded from a small number of individuals in the recent past. DNA profiles from four multilocus minisatellite probes were analyzed for adults and offspring from six social groups using two methods: (1) significance of band-sharing coefficients and (2) distribution among a group's offspring of fragments unique to certain adults. Traditional band-sharing analyses did not provide sufficient resolution to establish parentage in this population due to the high level of band-sharing between adults within groups. In contrast, the distribution of unique fragments suggests that in most cases, all offspring within a group have the same male and female genetic parents, so that monogamy may be the predominant "genetic" mating system of this species. This forces a rexamination of the evolutionary basis of polyandry in these birds. It also demonstrates some of the difficulties in using these highly polymorphic genetic markers for parentage analyses when putative parents are closely related. © 1994 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Consumption of pesticide granules by free‐ranging birds was quantified by applying blank (untreated silica granules to Iowa cornfields at rates varying from 3.9 to 17.3 kg/ha and examining the gizzards of birds collected from these fields for the presence of granules. One or more granules were found in the gizzards of 39% of 256 birds collected. Counts of gizzard granules averaged 0.6 to 0.9 for the three avian groups collected (horned larks, blackbirds, and sparrows). More than 95% of the specimens contained ≤3 granules; the maximum count was 6. On the basis of granule voiding experiments, we estimate that gizzard examinations detected 24% of the granules consumed per day. Median daily consumption for birds in general was estimated to be 2.4 granules, with 95% of individuals estimated to consume ≤18 granules. For the species with the highest consumption rate, the savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), median consumption was 11 granules per day, with 95% of individuals estimated to consume ≤23 granules per day. Granule availability on the soil surface was highly correlated with the application rate. Counts within the application band immediately after application averaged 15 granules/ft2 for every 1 kg/ha applied, or about 6% of the granules applied. Our results suggest that when granular pesticides are applied to cropland, many birds may ingest granules, but the numbers ingested will generally be low. Copyright © 1995 SETAC},

The Micronesian Kingfisher (Halcyon cinnamomina cinnamomina) and flightless Guam Rail (Rallus owsloni) once were endemic to the Pacific island of Guam and now survive only in captivity. Horizontal starch-gel electrophoresis and minisatellite DNA profiles were used to measure genetic diversity within and among the rails, kingfishers and closely related species. Allozyme analyses of Micronesian Kingfishers revealed no genetic diversity (29 enzymes screened). DNA profiles were variable, although similarity (S) among founders to the captive kingfisher population was high relative to nonendangered birds (s = 0.56 ± se of 0.02; 89 bands scored/individual). Three other Halcyon species examined had average allozyme heterozygosity and DNA similarity. Guam Rails had average to high allozyme heterozygosity as measured by four polymorphic loci (H = 0.03 to 0.05) relative to four other rail species (3 Rallus spp., 1 Porzana sp.). However, S (0.62 ± 0.02) was higher than in Micronesian Kingfishers. Further analyses indicated a significant deviation from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in two of three polymorphic loci for captive Guam Rails. Our results suggest that caution be taken in making generalizations about genetic diversity in island species. The type and number of genetic techniques used, number of species or populations examined, and variance in life-history traits among species must be considered.},

abstract={To monitor incubation conditions in nests of greater sandhill cranes, a radiotrans‐mitting egg was built using six temperature sensors, a position sensor, and a light sensor. Sensor readings were received, along with time of observations, and stored in a computer. The egg was used to monitor incubation in nests of six pairs of cranes during 1987 and 1988. Ambient temperature was also measured. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to relate highest egg temperature, core egg temperature, and lowest egg temperature to ambient temperature, time since the egg was last turned, and time since the beginning of incubation. Ambient temperature had the greatest effect on egg temperature (P &lt; 0.0001), followed by the time since the beginning of incubation and time since the egg was last turned. Pair effect, the class variable in the ANCOVA, was also very significant (P &lt; 0.0001). A nine‐term Fourier series was used to estimate the average core egg temperature versus time of day and was found to fit the data well (r2 = 0.94). The Fourier series will be used to run a mechanical incubator to simulate natural incubation conditions for cranes. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc. Copyright © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company},

abstract={The expense of gathering location data on birds and other wildlife using traditional techniques often discourages observers from obtaining frequent samples. To automate the direction-finding (DF) task important in radiolocation, a prototype system based on a circular array of antennas with no moving parts is described. It can operate continuously and rapidly, recording bearings on multiple radio transmitters. Using fewer than 10 pulses of a radio transmitter, DF stations report bearings. Static DF accuracy in open country was comparable to reported accuracy of manual methods in various habitats; performance in worstcase, real-life tests with small transmitters on wild passerines in secondary growth was poorer. In static tests, habitat features near the transmitter proved to be important in measurements using "dither." Such low-maintenance devices have advantages, especially for continuous recordings, for simultaneous localization of many subjects, and when access to a site is difficult.},

We found no effect of radio tagging on Prairie Falcon productivity (nesting success and brood size) among years, although productivity varied significantly among years. The sex of the falcon tagged did not affect productivity. Radio-tagged members of pairs did not differ significantly from un-tagged members of pairs in territory attendance, nest attendance, prey delivery rates, or caching rates. Nestlings raised by radio-tagged parents attained masses similar to those reared by control parents.

In addition, 1431 neck bands were put on 1714 of the leg-banded adults and subadults. During the period from September 1980 through May 1991, 3244 discrete, within-year resightings and recoveries were received of neck-banded and leg-banded birds during fall, winter, early spring, and late spring. During mid to late August each year, the Howe Island geese migrated eastward from the Prudhoe Bay area to staging/feeding areas in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska and in adjacent areas of the Yukon Territory. In mid to late September they moved southward down the Mackenzie Valley. Cluster analyses for the ten-year period 1980-90 revealed six separate distribution loci for the geese during the fall, with the largest proportion (84.7%) in one location in southeastern Alberta and southwestern Saskatchewan. Analyses revealed 11 separate distribution loci for the geese during winter from 1980 to 1991; the largest proportion (79.2%) was in northern California and southern Oregon. There were seven different distribution loci for the geese during early spring from 1981 to 1991; the largest proportion was in northern California and southeastern Oregon (81.4%). There were five distinct aggregations of the Howe Island geese during late spring from 1981 to 1991, with the largest proportion (79.1%) in staging/feeding areas in Montana, Alberta, and Saskatchewan. Most geese in both fly way s were faithful to specific overwintering locations from one year to the next. Of 262 birds for which year-to-year data were available, 98% in the Pacific Flyway returned to the same region in subsequent winters, and 90% in the Central Flyway returned to the same region. Nevertheless, some geese from both flyways moved to the other flyway during subsequent winters, and a few moved from the Pacific to the Central Flyway during the same winter. In general, the migration routes and overwintering areas of the Howe Island snow geese formed a pattern similar to that documented several decades ago for the much larger Western Arctic population, which nests mainly on Banks Island, Northwest Territories, Canada. The Howe Island geese are likely a satellite colony of the Western Arctic population.},

Carrier type and pesticide load per granule were evaluated in a separate experiment from granule size and color. In both experiments, captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus) were offered the granular pesticide formulations in bands on soil surfaces. Bird behavior, body weight, survival, and brain and plasma cholinesterase activity were used to assess pesticide exposure. Silica and clay carrier types posed a greater risk to birds than corncob granules. Exposure also was greater with a higher pesticide load per granule. Findings were inconclusive regarding the effect of granule size and color on avian exposure to granular pesticides. Precipitation seemed to increase the possibility of dermal exposure to the pesticide. It is important to consider factors in addition to those used currently by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency when evaluating the risk to birds from granular pesticides.},

abstract={Radio tracking via satellite was initiated to study the year- round movements of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos canadensis) breeding on the east coast of Hudson Bay. Quebec. In June and August 1992, six Golden Eagles (five adults and one juvenile) were marked, three of which completed their year-round movements. The eagles left their breeding area in mid- to late October and migrated to known wintering areas in the eastern United States. They used different routes but each followed the same general path during fall and spring migrations, which lasted between 26 and 40 days, and 25 and 51 days, respectively. Eagles wintered from 93 to 135 days in areas located 1,650 to 3,000 km south of their breeding territory. In spring 1993, satellite telemetry located the eagles in their former breeding territory in late March, mid-April and early May. This study confirms previous suggestions that some breeding Golden Eagles wintering in eastern United States come from northern Quebec and describes the first successful tracking of the complete yearly migration cycle of a bird of prey.},

No other organochlorine pesticides were detected (detection limit, 0.02 μg/g) in 1994. Mirex, oxychlordane, dieldrin, heptachlor epoxide, and the parent material DDT were routinely found in plasma samples in earlier years. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were found in 75% of the adult females in 1994, but PCB data collected in 1984 were not comparable. The decrease in organochlorine pesticide residues was associated with peregrine population increases in the Arctic and elsewhere in North America. The arctic peregrine (F. p. tundrius) was removed from the list of Threatened and Endangered Species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in 1994. Satellite telemetry and plasma sampling provide new insight into continuing sources of DDE and PCBs. Chemicals that replaced organochlorine pesticides require additional investigation in North and South America.},

Transmitter-equipped cormorants were located at 15 different roost sites during the study. The mean number of roosts used by cormorants was 2.08 ± 0.172 SE. The mean number of transmitter-equipped cormorants located each week was 8.25 ± 0.87 SE. The distances moved by cormorants among night roosts ranged from 0-398 km. In the eastern part of the Delta Region two studies were conducted concurrently with this telemetry study to determine if repeated harassment of roosting cormorants using pyrotechnics would cause cormorants to abandon selected roosts and nearby aquaculture facilities. Dispersed roosts were repeatedly harassed with pyrotechnics in the eastern part of the Delta Region and non-dispersed roosts in the western part of the Delta Region were not harassed. There was no significant difference in cormorant movement to more than one roost after transmitter attachment between birds captured in dispersed roosts versus non-dispersed roosts. Three transmitter-equipped cormorants were located on the Gulf coast approximately 390 km from the study area. One subsequently moved back to the study area. These observations provide evidence that in Mississippi wintering populations of cormorants show no strong fidelity to a primary roost, but shift throughout the Delta Region and to the Gulf coast.},

abstract={We studied the migratory movements of radio-equipped Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) along a 4,000 km stretch of the west coast of North America from California to Alaska during the 1992 spring migration. A total of 77 shorebirds were radio-tagged at San Francisco Bay, CA; Bolinas Lagoon, CA; Fraser River Delta, British Columbia; and the Stikine River Delta, AK. Daily aerial and ground monitoring from mid-April to late May at banding sites as well as the Copper River Delta provided data on length of stay of individual shorebirds and migration times between study areas. Fifty-eight shorebirds were detected beyond banding sites for a 74% net relocation rate. The proportion of birds detected along the migration route increased with latitude: Grays Harbor, WA (3.4%); Fraser River, British Columbia (8.6%); Stikine River, AK (28.6%); and Copper River, AK (62.3%). Length of stay averaged three days per site. We failed to detect differences in length of stay among sites or between sexes. A condition index calculated as body mass standardized for body size was a poor indicator of length of stay at a site or migration time among sites. An estimated 26% of radio-equipped birds were never relocated suggesting that migrant birds use smaller dispersed wetlands as well as the major intertidal wetland complexes we studied. We conclude that most spring migrant Western Sandpipers use a short-flight hopping migration strategy rather than a few sustained long flights. The short-flight strategy emphasizes the importance of maintaining a continuous complex of intertidal wetland habitats along the migration route to ensure shorebird conservation.},

abstract={We developed and evaluated a surgical procedure for implanting intra- abdominal radiotransmitters with external whip antennas in captive mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). Transmitters were implanted in the abdominal cavity and the antennas exited through the caudal abdominal wall and skin. Birds with implanted transmitters developed mild to moderate localized air sac reactions. These reactions involved adhesions of the right anterior abdominal air sac to the liver with contractions around the transmitters and antenna catheters. The adhesions were reinforced by a proliferation of connective tissue and lined by multinucleated giant cells (foreign body reaction). Casual observation indicated that neither behavior nor activity of the birds was altered by the histological reaction to the transmitter implant. No increase in systemic lesions (particularly liver or kidney) could be correlated with the histological reactions. Our evaluations indicate that the procedure is a reliable method for radiomarking ducks and the technique has been successfully used in 2 field studies.},

Every two days (from hatching [late April] until juvenile dispersal [mid-October]) we visited control nest stands and provided food at treatment nest stands. We measured morphological characteristics and attached tarsal-mounted transmitters with mortality switches to 42 nestling Northern Goshawks when they were 21 days old. In both 1992 and 1993, we relocated birds via telemetry every other day until mid-August. We located birds at least once a week from mid-August until mid-October in 1992, and until late-November 1993. There were no significant differences in nestling size. Treatment birds had a significantly higher survival rate during the nestling period in 1993, but not in 1992. Because most control nestlings died from predation, we attribute higher nestling survival to increased time spent in nest stands by adult females, whose presence probably deterred predators.},

abstract={We described quantitatively 19 summer plumage characteristics and bill and foot pigmentation of 247 known-age Laughing Gulls (Larus atricilla) collected in New York during 1992-1994. There were no differences in characteristics measured for male and female Laughing Gulls. Ninety percent of 2-yr-old Laughing Gulls and 96% of ≥3-yr-old birds had full hoods. Fifty-seven percent of 2-yr-old Laughing Gulls possessed at least partial tail bands in contrast to 4% of 3-yr-old and 0% of ≥4-yr-old gulls. Thus 2-and ≥3-yr-old Laughing Gulls cannot be separated reliably by the presence or absence of a tail band. Pink pigmentation on the breast or abdomen occurred in 12% of individuals and was unrelated to age. Using the presence or absence of a distinct black-and-gray interface on the distal portion of the fifth primary, we correctly classified 96% of 245 2-and ≥3-yr-old Laughing Gulls. Using this characteristic in combination with the length of distinct black pigmentation present on the proximal vane of the sixth primary, we correctly aged 98% of 244 gulls. This technique and previously published plumage characteristics provide rapid and accurate classification of Laughing Gulls in summer plumage as <1, 1, 2, or ≥3 yr of age.},

abstract={We summarized sandhill crane (Grus canadensis [cranes]) counts from Mexico recorded during 23 January aerial waterfowl surveys by the U.S Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) between 1953 and 1994 Cranes were recorded at 39 areas in 14 states; 974% were in the Northern Highlands, 0.4% in the Central Highlands, 1.5% along the Gulf Coast, and 0.7% on the Pacific Coast. Most wintered in the states of Chihuahua (91.7%) and Durango (4.7%). Total counts of >30,000 cranes were recorded in 1979 and 1994; 70,000 were reported in Chihuahua in February 1947. Laguna de Babicora, Chihuahua, was the most important winter area. We also conducted ground and aerial surveys in Chihuahua during most winters 1970-92 and occasionally in Durango and Sonora. We found a mean of 21,649 cranes at 6 study areas in Chihuahua with highest mean counts at Laguna de Babicora (16,012), followed by Ascension (2,405) and Laguna de los Mexicanos (1,469). Our surveys indicated that >50,000 cranes winter in Mexico. At 6 study areas in Chihuahua, all 3 migratory subspecies were present with the lesser subspecies (G. c. canadensis [lessers]) composing 889%. The greater (G. c. tabida [greaters]) and Canadian subspecies (G. c. rowani [Canadians]) composed the remainder but could not be differentiated in field surveys; about 25% of cranes classified as greaters may have been Canadians. Annual recruitment and brood size averaged 10.1% and 1.18 in lessers and 6.5% and 1.14 in greaters. Lessers and Canadians wintering in the Interior Highlands belong to the Western Subpopulation of the Midcontinent Population (MCP), while greaters are from the Rocky Mountain Population (RMP). Based oil sightings of marked cranes, band recoveries, and field observations, we estimated that about 10% of the RMP wintered in Mexico in Chihuahua and Durango. RMP cranes were more abundant in northern Chihuahua than at sites farther south (P < 0.001) Gulf Coast cranes are probably Canadians and lessers from the MCP, Gulf Coast Subpopulation. Population affiliations of Pacific Coast cranes are uncertain. Laguna de Babicora, the must important crane wintering area in Mexico, is threatened by proposed habitat alterations. Loss of this wetland would adversely affect cranes and other migratory birds, including several endangered species. Conservation plans and action are needed to protect this key winter site.},

During the 1980s and early 1990s, declines in the numbers of Sharp-shinned Hawks sighted at many of these sites raised concerns about the population status of the species. Using count data from Hawk Mountain Sanctuary, Pennsylvania, and Cape May Point, New Jersey, we offer additional evidence that the reported decline is greater at raptor-migration watch sites along the Atlantic coast than at sites farther inland. Band-recovery data for fall migrants indicate that Hawk Mountain Sanctuary and Cape May Point count birds that essentially are from the same eastern population. An analysis of Christmas-bird-count data for easternmost North America during the 1980s indicates significant increases in the numbers of Sharp-shinned Hawks observed north of the two sites. We suggest that at least part of the decline in numbers of Sharp-shinned Hawks sighted at traditional watch sites in eastern North America may result from migratory short stopping.

abstract={Band-recovery data for Ring-billed (Larus delawarensis) and Herring (L. argentatus) Gulls were analyzed to determine the origins of gulls breeding within the Great Lakes region, the extent of lake and colony fidelity, and the winter and breeding season distributions of gulls of various age classes. Most Great Lakes Ring-billed Gulls wintered along the Gulf Coast, especially in Florida. Most Herring Gulls wintered along Lakes Erie, Ontario, and Michigan, although first-winter birds were more widely distributed and were recovered at greater distances than older birds. Movement into or out of the Great Lakes region by gulls of breeding age was minimal. However, movement among colonies and lakes was much more extensive; lakes and colonies do not define distinct populations. Gulls banded as chicks tended to return as adults to the lake, but not necessarily to the colony, where they where banded. Gulls banded as breeding adults were more likely to return in subsequent breeding seasons to the colony at which they had been banded than were chicks recovered as breeding adults. Gulls are probably not as colony-tenacious as previously believed, and natal dispersal plays a significant role in establishing or maintaining colonies. Management plans for Great Lakes Ring-billed and Herring Gull colonies should consider the effects of inter-lake and inter-colony dispersal.},

abstract={This study was conducted to help assess whether recent harvest rates of ducks handed before the hunting season in the United States varied among stocks (i.e., species, age sex cohort, location of banding) and whether regulatory actions have been successful at shifting harvest pressure among stocks in the desired manner. Direct recovery rates during 1976-91 were used to index harvest rates and were influenced to some degree by location of banding, age class, sex, species, and hunting regulations. However, differences in recovery probability among species were consistent (P = 0.787) over 3 periods with different hunting regulations (1976-84, 1985-87, 1988- 91), despite regulatory changes designed to affect species differentially. Band-recovery models that excluded the interaction between hunting regulations and sex of ducks were inadequate (P ≤ 0.013), suggesting sex- specific changes in recovery probabilites with changes in regulations. There was little evidence (P ≤ 0.151) that regulatory changes affected recovery rates of ducks from 3 banding reference areas differentially. Harvesting duck stocks in an optimal manner requires an ability to harvest selectively, a good understanding of each stock's dynamics, and knowledge of any interdependence in stock sizes.},

abstract={Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum) with orange (instead of the normal yellow) tail bands have appeared in eastern North America in the last 35 years. Biochemical studies have implicated a dietary cause (Hudon and Brush 1989), specifically the fruits of Lonicera morrowii (Brush 1990), for this novel color variant. I show that rectrices replaced while Cedar Waxwings are feeding on L. morrowii fruits develop orange tips. Rectrices replaced subsequent to switching the diet of molting waxwings from L. morrowii fruits to dog chow were yellow, showing close temporal correspondence between dietary input of rhodoxanthin and the coloration of growing feathers. In the Ithaca vicinity, fruits of L. morrowii are eaten by wild Cedar Waxwings from June until mid-October. The extended pattern of availability and consumption of Lonicera in this region appears to explain my unique observations of adult Cedar Waxwings growing orange tails during the fall months. Cedar Waxwings maintained body condition and molted while on an extended diet of L. morrowii fruits (36 days for two birds and 64 days for two others). Three birds initiated tail molt while on this diet, including one that molted all of its flight feathers. These results emphasize the nutritional specialization of Cedar Waxwings to a diet of sugary, low-protein fruits, and show that molt occurs in an apparently normal manner when birds are eating a low-protein fruit diet.},

As part of a larger study of pipit nesting ecology, we monitored activity patterns of radio-tagged adult females in 1994 and 1995. Three birds started replacement nests 10-15 days after losing a clutch, and one started a second nest 21 dayss after succesfully fledging chicks. Such long intervals between nesting attempts support the impression that the frequency of renesting in pipits is relatively low.},

abstract={Management of northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) in northwestern California is aided by knowledge of its prey base, the dusky- footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes). From late april through September 1990, we radiotracked 25 dusky-footed woodrats representing both sexes and a cross section of age classes (ad, subad, and juv). Animals were captured in sapling/poletimber shrubfields resulting from past clearcut timber harvest. In northwestern California woodrats reach their highest densities in this seral stage. During evening radiotracking sessions, we detected intermittent, short distance movements of juvenile and subadult males and females, and adult females from shrubfields into adjacent old-growth forests occupied by spotted owls. None of the radiotagged woodrats permanently emigrated to older-aged forests during our study period. Between-year emigration from shrubfield to old forest, however, was documented for marked individuals. Our telemetry results indicate that woodrats are not averse to crossing sharp ecotonal boundaries from shrubfields into adjacent old forest, into canopy openings in these forests, or into natural openings within dense shrubfields. A substantial number of our radiotagged woodrats were killed by predators, with carcasses most often (5 of 9 depredated woodrats) found in adjacent old forest. These observations suggest that during these between-habitat forays, woodrats may be more vulnerable to avian and mammal predators. Therefore, to some degree, the existence of brushy shrubfields adjacent to older forest may increase the availability of woodrats to predators, such as spotted owls, that exploit prey from a variety of habitat but spend the majority of their time hunting in late seral stage forests.},

abstract={Extraterritorial forays are one specialized tactic that females use to obtain extrapair copulations (EPCs). By radio-tracking female hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina) during the breeding season, we found that females made covert forays onto neighboring territories. Almost 80% of females made extraterritorial forays during their fertile stages, but none visited territories during the nonfertile (incubation) stage, which is consistent with the extraterritorial foray hypothesis. Females that left their territories visited from one to four neighboring territories, and they intruded at a rate of 0.6 territories/h. The propensity of females to foray from their territory did not correlate with body size or age of the social mate. One female that left her territory obtained an extrapair fertilization. Females may use forays to assess male quality as well as participate in extrapair copulations. An alternative hypothesis for extra-territorial forays is that females may foray onto neighboring territories to obtain food during the energetically stressful period of egg production. The extraterritorial foray hypothesis and foraging hypothesis may not be mutually exclusive. Females may obtain benefits of foraging while at the same time assessing males for EPCs. Extraterritorial behavior of female birds may be more common than previously believed and in many cases may only be ruled out through radio-tracking.},

abstract={We studied the tarrying behavior and habitat selection of radio-tagged Prairie Falcons (Falco mexicanus) during the breeding season in southwestern Idaho. The distribution and numbers of Townsend's ground squirrels (Spermophilus townsendii), the primary prey of Prairie Falcons in our study area, varied in response to drought during the study period. Prairie Falcons ranged over large areas (ca. 300 km2) and increased their foraging ranges in response to declining ground squirrels. Reptiles and birds were preyed upon most frequently when squirrels were rare. Males and females differed little in their use of space successful pairs ranged over smaller areas than non-nesters and unsuccessful pairs. Falcons nesting near habitat most suitable for ground squirrels ranged over smaller areas than those nesting farther from such habitat. Home ranges contained significantly more winterfat (Ceratoides lanata) and native perennial grosses (especially Poa secunda), and significantly less salt desert shrubs and exotic annual grasses than expected based on availability. Salt desert shrubs were found less than expected, bared on availability in core areas within home ranges. Selection for winterfat and bluegrass in core areas was contingent upon selection at the larger scale of the home range; falcons with home ranges containing more winterfat and bluegrass than expected based on availability were less selective in their placement of core areas with respect to these habitats. We believe salient features of Prairie Falcon home ranges result largely from patchy distribution of landscape features associated with different densities and availabilities of Townsend's ground squirrels.},

abstract={A combination of direct (mark-resight) and indirect genetic methods were used to investigate natal dispersal patterns and genetic population structure in a population of North American pikas, Ochotona princeps. Pikas are small lagomorphs found in talus habitat of alpine areas throughout western North America. Adult pikas are individually territorial and rarely disperse. I used multilocus DNA fingerprinting to identify the parents of juvenile animals. The settlement pattern of marked juveniles and the pattern of relatedness of pikas across the study site was then examined within the study area. Although juveniles born at the study site exhibited a philopatric settlement pattern, an isolation-by-distance analysis did not reveal clusters of highly related individuals within the population. The F(ST) estimate suggests little genetic differentiation between populations 2 km apart, and average DNA fingerprinting band-sharing among adults was similar to values reported for outbred species. An average of 34% of the adult population was replaced each winter by immigrants. DNA fingerprinting band-sharing analysis suggests that these immigrants had dispersed short, intermediate, and long distances. These findings differ from earlier studies which used observations of marked animals only to characterize dispersal patterns. Direct observations of marked juveniles had documented a philopatric settlement pattern, little or no dispersal out of natal populations, and no direct evidence of long distance movement. Of the three major hypotheses proposed to explain the evolution of dispersal in birds and mammals, competition h~r resources, competition for mates, and inbreeding avoidance, the results of this study support a competition for resources hypothesis, where the key resource is territory.},

abstract={We analyzed 30 years of Christmas Bird Count (CBC) data for Florida populations of six species of wading birds: Great, Cattle, and Snowy Egrets; Little Blue and Tricolored Herons; and the Wood Stork, a federally listed endangered species. These species are conspicuous components of wetland ecosystems, and the target of numerous management efforts in the state and region. The nonlinear dynamics of these populations were assessed through time series of birds seen during volunteer-based surveys and the first differences of successive annual counts, autocorrelations, and two new metrics: correlation time and a momentum oscillator. CBCs have the advantage of being conducted regularly over a large geographic scale. When properly analyzed, CBCs are among the few available sources of reliable population information for small, dark-plumaged species such as Little Blue and Tricolored Herons. Population trends assessed for all species by CBCs paralleled the known or suspected trends determined by breeding-season aerial and ground surveys, conducted by professional biologists. Cattle Egret populations have declined following rapid expansion through the 1960s and 1970s; Snowy Egret and, to a lesser extent, Tricolored Heron populations have declined throughout the study period; Little Blue Heron and Great Egret numbers have been relatively stable. Wood Storks, following a period of decline that lasted into the mid-1970s, slowly recovered through the 1980s. Only Cattle Egrets displayed strongly deterministic population dynamics, indicating that predictions of population trends for the other species will require stochastic models with broad confidence bands.},

abstract={Sex biased natal dispersal is common among many bird species, with females usually dispersing farthest. The relative dispersal distances of male and female American Kestrels (Falco sparverius) are unknown. We examined natal dispersal in Southeastern American Kestrels (F.s. paulus) in north-central Florida, observing birds marked as nestlings with either color bands or patagial tags. Natal dispersal distances of 34 kestrels ranged from 0.0 to 38.8 km. Mean natal dispersal distance of females (8.6 km) did not differ significantly from that of males (8.3 km) (P = 0.43). We determined that no relationship existed for either sex between dispersal distance and subsequent reproductive success. However, the relationship between hatching date and dispersal distance was marginally significant (P = 0.071); fledglings from earlier nests were more likely to breed close to their natal area than were those from late-season nests. Our results suggest that natal dispersal and site fidelity in Southeastern American Kestrels are determined, at least in part, by inter- and intra-sexual competition for breeding sites.},

In the first experiment, silica and corncob granules formulated with fensulfothion at either 1/2 or 1/32 of the median lethal dose (LD50) were offered to captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus) in bands on dry soil. The corncob carrier and granules formulated with 1/2 the LD50 presented the greatest risk to birds. In the second experiment, fensulfothion was formulated on three carrier types (silica, clay, and corncob) and offered to house sparrows in bands on wet or dry soil. Overall, formulations with corncob as the carrier and dry soil conditions presented the greatest risk to birds. Wet soil conditions reduced the risk of adverse effects for all three granular carrier types, but the greatest risk reduction occurred with corncob and silica granules. Differences in adverse effects associated with various carrier types and soil moisture conditions can add complexity when assessing risk to birds from granular pesticides.},

Poorwill roosts had significantly less green vegetation, less overhead cover, more bare ground, and were further away from tall objects than random sites. Our results are consistent with the prediction that roost sites would consist mostly of areas which likely contrast less with poorwill's mottled brown plumage.

Given the small North American population (ca. 20,000 pairs) and the large decrease which occurred in the Gulf of St. Lawrence during the 1970s, an intensive effort to band Razorbills on the North Shore of the gulf and to a less extent in Labrador was accomplished between 1981 and 1995. Using banding recoveries of Razorbills from this operation, and former one on the Atlantic coast, we traced their movements and showed how the species could be exposed to different risks during the non-breeding season. More than 50% of the recoveries came from the legal Thick-billed Murre (Uria lomvia) hunt in Newfoundland, suggesting that shooting could be the most important mortality factor for immature birds. A study of color-banded birds combined with triangular bands that could be read from a distance was started in 1990 at St. Mary's Islands (Quebec) and suggests a mean annual adult survival rate of 90%. This measure of adult survival combined with productivity figures and current population trends allowed to estimate a 38% survival rate for immatures.},

After crossing the Alaska Range, swans stopped briefly on the Susitna Flats of Upper Cook Inlet. They then migrated eastward into the Yukon, Canada, and from there flew southward, paralleling the Wrangell Mountains through the interior of the Yukon to a staging area in northeastern British Columbia. They gradually migrated through central Alberta and southwest Saskatchewan and across Montana to a staging area in southeastern Idaho. They remained in southeastern Idaho from mid-November until early December when they migrated across Nevada to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta of California. Spring migration routes were similar to those used in autumn. Band returns and observations of neck-banded swans corroborated the general autumn and spring migration routes of PTT-marked birds.

Flight performance models suggest that the 1.6-g transmitter shortens the migratory range of wood thrushes by only 60 km, and the estimated migratory range is adequate to accomplish migration even with limited fat stores. We used two strengths of line, 5- and 9-kg test-strength braided Dacron, to attach the transmitters using the thigh-harness method. We recaptured 13 returning radio-marked wood thrushes, seven of which were still marked. Six of the seven birds marked with the 5-kg test harnesses lost their transmitters within 1 yr while all six of the 9-kg test harnesses were still attached up to 21 mo later. Radio-marking did not reduce the return rates of adults and immatures, and the transmitters did not cause radio-marked birds to lose more mass than banded-only birds. Wood Thrushes can successfully carry a transmitter during migration with no detectable negative effects. We recommend continued use of the thigh-harness method, but we encourage the use of 5-kg cotton line.},

Wingbeats modulated the continuous signals, and signal-processing techniques permitted examination of wingbeat frequency (WBF) during nocturnal migration. Distinct takeoff and cruising-flight phases were evident in both species. As birds climbed during the takeoff phase (which usually lasted about 15 min), WBF typically declined exponentially by at least 4 Hz. Median cruising WBF from seven flights varied from 9.2 to 10.9 Hz, values similar to those calculated from published equations predicting WBF based on flight mechanics. Cruising WBF typically varied slowly and irregularly throughout all flights by about 1 Hz. During takeoff and cruising flights, all birds flapped continuously, showing no evidence of the flap-coasting pattern common in passerine migrants previously studied with other techniques such as radar. All five birds exhibited departure times, course directions, and flight distances typical for migrating thrushes.},

abstract={Previous mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) telemetry studies using transmitter glue attachment have found the technique to be relatively short term (<10 weeks), and that transmitter harnesses possibly have deleterious effects on doves. To improve attachment methods, we developed and refined surgical techniques for implanting subcutaneous and intra-abdominal radiotransmitters with external whip antennas in mourning doves, and we determined physiological and pathological responses to the transmitter implants. We used a captive colony of 200 wild-trapped mourning doves to develop and test procedures for subcutaneous implants (SC1), subcutaneous surgeries without implants (SC2), intra-abdominal implants (IA1), intra-abdominal surgeries without implants (IA2), and a control group without surgeries or implants (CNT); 20 males and 20 females were assigned to each experimental group. Surgeries for IA1 took less time (3.58 ± 0.17 min; x̄ ± SE; P < 0.001) than SC1 surgeries (4.36 ± 0.12 min). Heterophil:lymphocyte ratios showed that IA1 and IA2 doves had higher (P = 0.024) posttreatment changes compared with SC1, SC2, or CNT groups. At 4-6 days postsurgery, 153 of 160 (95.6%) doves with surgical treatments showed closed or healed surgical sites with no complications. At 14 days posttreatment, 34 (87%) SC1 implants were located in the thoracic inlet. Gross necropsy findings at 10 weeks postsurgery found that 36 of 39 (92%) SC1 and 36 of 39 (92%) IA1 implants showed little or no tissue response to the implants. Functioning transmitters began failing 2 weeks posttreatment, and 85% were not working at 10 weeks posttreatment. Our data suggest subcutaneous implants with external antennas were a better alternative compared to intra-abdominal implants with external antennas, but further testing is needed to compare subcutaneous implants to conventional attachment techniques.},

abstract={Extra-pair fertilizations are common in birds, which has led to great interest in how this phenomenon is regulated at a proximate level and how extra-pair fertilizations, and extra-pair fertilization avoidance, shape avian social systems. In Wilson's phalaropes, Phalaropus tricolor, incubation and brood-rearing is performed exclusively by males. Males are able to rear only a single brood of four during a breeding season. This suggests that males have a high level of paternity in clutches and broods under their care and, thus, that extra-pair fertilizations are infrequent. In contrast, female social dominance, lack of territoriality and frequent interactions among breeding adults suggest that both males and females have the opportunity to engage in extra-pair copulations. Using DNA fingerprint band-sharing between putative parents and offspring, we found no evidence of extra-pair fertilizations among 51 offspring from 17 families of phalaropes. Copulation disruption by non-copulatory adults, ability of females to reject copulation attempts and potential fitness benefits to females by avoiding extra-pair fertilizations were sufficient to explain the absence of extra-pair fertilizations in Wilson's phalaropes. We propose that sex-role reversal affects the relative costs and benefits to females of seeking extra-pair fertilizations. At the time of clutch completion, females have invested particularly heavily in their clutches due to intense competition among females to gain and keep a mate during the pre-laying and laying periods. After clutch completion, nest success requires significant male parental care. Benefits to females in gaining extra-pair fertilizations may be offset by the risk of losing male parental care.},

Owlet-nightjars preferentially roosted in tree cavities closer to the ground, in trees with a significantly greater number of cavities and significantly closer to another tree with a cavity than expected by chance. There was also a significant interaction between cavity height and number of cavities in the tree. Tree size, decay stage and tree species were not statistically important cues used for making site choices. The requirements for Owlet-nightjars differ from those of most other Australian birds that use tree holes and also from most insectivorous bats. Telemetry data indicate that Owlet-nightjars move ∼300 m between roost sites every 9 days on average. Individual birds used 2-6 different cavities during the 1-4-month period over which they were followed. The reasons for the relatively low levels of site fidelity are unknown.},

abstract={The relative importance of cottonwood-willow riparian corridors and isolated oases to land birds migrating across southeastern Arizona was evaluated during four spring migrations, 1989 to 1994, based on patterns of species richness, relative abundance, density, and body condition of birds. We surveyed birds in 13 study sites ranging in size and connectivity from small isolated patches to extensive riparian forest, sampled vegetation and insects, and captured birds in mistnets. The continuous band of riparian vegetation along the San Pedro River does not appear to be functioning as a corridor for many migrating species, although it may for a few, namely Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens), Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra), and Northern Rough-winged Swallows (Steldigopteryx serripennis), which account for fewer than 10% of the individuals migrating through the area. Small, isolated oases hosted more avian species than the corridor sites, and the relative abundances of most migrating birds did not differ between sites relative to size-connectivity. There were few differences in between-year variability in the relative abundances of migrating birds between corridor and oasis sites. Between-year variability decreased with overall abundance of species and was greater for species with breeding ranges that centered north of 50°N latitude. Body condition of birds did not differ relative to the size-connectivity of the capture site, but individuals of species with more northerly breeding ranges had more body fat than species that breed nearby. Peak migration densities of several bird species far exceeded breeding densities reported for the San Pedro River, suggesting that large components of these species were en route migrants. Peak densities of Yellow Warblers (Dendroica petechia) reached 48.0 birds/ha, of Wilson's Warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) 33.7 birds/ha, and of Yellow-rumped Warblers (D. coronata) 30.1 birds/ha. Riparian vegetation is limited in extent in the vicinity of our study sites, covering less than 1% of the landscape. We conclude that all riparian patches in southeastern Arizona are important as stopover sites to en route migrants regardless of their size and degree of isolation or connectivity. In light of potential habitat limitation, the protection of both small, disjunct riparian patches and extensive riverine tracts in western landscapes is imperative.},

We used radio telemetry to study the postfledging ecology of juvenile Wood Thrushes (Hytocichla mustelina) in the Ozark Mountains of southern Missouri. Natal home ranges were in mature oak-hickory forest, and natal home-range size ranged from 2.6 to 24.8 ha. Juveniles dispersed independently from their natal home ranges to post-dispersal ranges, with a mean dispersal direction of 185.2 ± SD of 77.2°and a mean distance of 2.08 ± 1.48 km. Habitats used after dispersal differed from natal habitats and included early successional oak-hickory and pine forests, mid-successional pine forest, mature riparian forest, and forest/field edges. These habitats were characterized by a dense understory and thick ground cover. Post-dispersal home-range size averaged 1.53 ha. Our data suggest that in large tracts of mature deciduous forest, a mosaic of early and mid-successional forest stands, along with mature riparian forest, will accommodate both the breeding and post-dispersal habitat requirements of Wood Thrushes and other Neotropical migratory birds.},

abstract={The mourning dove (Zenaida macroura) call-count index had a significant (P < 0.01) negative trend in South Carolina and the Eastern Management Unit (EMU) during 1988-97. We initiated a banding study in 2 areas in the Coastal Plain of South Carolina to estimate population demographic parameters of doves to generate hypotheses that address the purported population declines. During 1992-96, we banded >2,300 doves and examined >6,000 individuals during harvest bag checks. An age-specific band recovery model with time- and area-specific recovery rates, and constant survival rates, was chosen for estimation via Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC), likelihood ratio, and goodness-of-fit criteria. After-hatching-year (AHY) annual survival rate was 0.359 (SE = 0.056), and hatching-year (HY) annual survival rate was 0.118 (SE = 0.042). Average estimated recruitment per adult female into the prehunting season population was 3.40 (SE = 1.25) and 2.32 (SE = 0.46) for the 2 study areas. Our movement data support earlier hypotheses of nonmigratory breeding and harvested populations in South Carolina. Low survival rates and estimated population growth rate in the study areas may be representative only of small-scale areas that are heavily managed for dove hunting. Source-sink theory was used to develop a model of region-wide populations that is composed of source areas with positive growth rates and sink areas of declining growth. We suggest management of mourning doves in the Southeast might benefit from improved understanding of local population dynamics, as opposed to regional-scale population demographics.},

abstract={Fensulfothion was formulated on silica granules to evaluate the relationship between avian risk of adverse effects from granular pesticides and granule availability. Captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus) were offered the granular pesticide in bands on soil surfaces at application rates of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1,200, 1,600, or 2,000 LD50/ft2. Individual pesticide granules were formulated with 1/4 the LD50 for house sparrows (0.3 mg/kg). Bird behavior, survival, and brain cholinesterase activity were used to assess pesticide exposure. A significant negative correlation between brain ChE activity and the natural logarithm of application rate indicated that the relationship between avian risk and granule availability was asymptotic rather than linear. Thus, the assumption, implicit in the LD50/ft2 risk index, that the potential exposure of birds to granular pesticides increases as granule availability increases may result in overestimates of risk to birds from granular pesticides, particularly at higher granule application rates.},

abstract={The Yellow-shouldered Amazon (Amazona barbadensis) is one of the most endangered species of parrots in Venezuela. An integrated conservation program has focused on reversing the causes of parrot population decline on the Macanao Peninsula in Margarita Island. As a result, the parrot population on the island has increased to about 1900 individuals in 1996 from an estimated population of 750 in 1989, when the project started. Cooperation from national and local authorities and the project's community outreach have resulted in several confiscated chicks. Whereas most confiscated chicks were successfully reintroduced in a cross-fostering nest program, some had to be kept in captivity for later release. We hand-reared 14 A. barbadensis and housed them for a year in a large outdoor aviary. Before release the birds were screened to determine their general health. Four parrots were fitted with radio transmitters and monitored for a minimum of 11 months. All 4 birds with radio transmitters survived and adapted successfully to their natural environment, 10 of the 12 released parrots survived at least 1 year, and 1 was seen alive 34 months after release. Integration into wild groups varied from 5 days to 9 months, with the two youngest parrots showing a slower integration process. None of the parrots reproduced the first year after release. Later three were seen scouting nesting holes with their partners, and one of the parrots was confirmed attending a nest with three eggs 28 months after release. Two chicks fledged from this nest. A substantial portion of the success of this program rests on 5 years of previous work on environmental education, public awareness, and studies on the parrot's biology. To provide some guidance on the costs of reintroduction projects, we estimated an overall expenditure of about U.S. $2800 per parrot. Previous attempts to reintroduce captive-raised parrots have had limited success, and our study indicates that reintroduction is feasible when captive-raised parrots are introduced to an area with a resident population. Although reintroduction can significantly reduce the chances of extinction, it also involves some risks. The long-term solution against extinction of A. barbadensis will be a combination of scientific understanding of their biology and habitat, awareness by local human communities, reduction in the wild bird trade, and continued commitment by conservation enforcement agencies.},

abstract={Penguins rely on vision to travel and hunt at sea. Vision in marine predators, particularly those hunting phototactic prey under a broad range of light intensities, must be better understood to realize how these species respond to changes in their environment. We studied the effects of daily cycles in light intensity on visual predators by examining the duration and timing of chinstrap penguins' Pygoscelis antarctica foraging trips and the size, composition, and timing of their meals. We used radio telemetry and stomach-contents sampling to study adult penguins that were provisioning chicks during the summers of 1993 and 1994 at Seal Island, Antarctica. The penguins rarely initiated or terminated foraging trips at night, but otherwise varied the timing and duration of trips to sea. Cluster analyses using departure and arrival times revealed 5 distinct modes of foraging: 3 were strictly diurnal (early, mid-, and late) and 2 were partly nocturnal (overnight and extended). Durations of diurnal trips (4 to 11 h) were shorter than overnight (13 to 14 h) and extended trips (18 to 22 h). Early and mid-diurnal trips and extended trips were significantly shorter in 1993 than in 1994; late diurnal and overnight trip durations did not differ between years. Diurnal foraging was most common in 1993, whereas overnight foraging predominated in 1994. Shortened diurnal foraging in 1993 appears to have increased the frequency of diurnal foraging by allowing more parent birds to alternate diurnal trips within a single day and by reducing the incidence of birds extending diurnal foraging through the night. That penguins foraged more frequently by day when permitted by shorter trip durations (in 1993) suggests that they opted to forage diurnally whenever possible. Returning diurnal and overnight foragers had greater than 99 and 74% Antarctic krill Euphausia superba by weight in their stomachs, respectively. However, overnight foragers also returned with significant amounts of highly digested remains of pelagic fish, suggesting birds were in offshore waters taking fish during the night. In contrast, only 1 out of 40 diurnal foragers from both years combined had evidence of fish. Thus, the daily light cycle affected both the timing and duration of chinstrap penguin foraging as well as the type of prey consumed during trips to sea.},

abstract={The bright coloration of plastic leg bands used in avian research has been shown to affect the social interactions of birds by augmenting the ornamentation that traditionally mediates intersexual mate choice and/or intrasexual competition for mates. With ultraviolet (UV) vision and plumage reflectance playing a role in the mating decisions of some species, it would seem important to examine the UV reflectance properties of colored bands, as these bands may be providing strong and meaningful UV color signals that are invisible to the human eye and are potentially unaccounted for in most avian behavioral studies. In this study, we used a fiber optic spectrometer and a UV/visible light source to collect spectral reflectance data for the commonly used types and colors of bands and showed that none exhibit peak reflectance values throughout the range of LV wavelengths that is visible to birds. Instead, UV reflectance of colored bands at these wavelengths is comparable to levels of background reflectance found elsewhere in the avian visible spectrum. Consequently, colored bands lack discrete UV color signals and can safely be used in studies of wild birds with a minimal risk of influencing intraspecific signaling that is based on ultraviolet ornamentation. However, caution must be exercised when using these bands under experimental conditions, as certain treatments (e.g., indoor lighting, one-way glass, sunscreens) may mask the background levels of UV reflectance that still contribute to the overall band color, effectively inducing a color change in the bands that could provide unnatural visual cues to the birds and unintentionally influence their social interactions.},

We compared survival, weekly mass gain, and mark retention among groups of chicks marked with patagial wing bands, PITs, and plastic and aluminum leg bands (control; n = 50/treatment). We detected no differences among marking methods in growth (P = 0.558) or survival to 12 weeks posthatch (P > 0.050). Of those birds that survived to 12 weeks posthatch, 2 birds (approx 5%) from each of the PIT and patagial band groups lost their marks. Tag destruction during simulated harvest did not differ between PIT-tagged and wing-banded groups (P = 0.126). In this captive experiment, both techniques had minimal effects on measured parameters and thus may be useful field-marking techniques. Because of our results, lower cost, and external visibility of patagial markers, we advocate use of patagial markers to tag bobwhite chicks for studies of chick survival, harvest rate, and site fidelity.},

abstract={We compared the performance of two models of satellite transmitters and two types of attachments to track Greater Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) from their Arctic breeding grounds to their wintering areas along the Atlantic coast of the United States. Six birds were fitted with a Toyocom T-2038 attached with a back-mounted harness (141 g, vertical upward antenna) in 1993, 5 with a back-mounted Telonics ST-10 (116 g, horizontal antenna) in 1994, and 11 with a Telonics ST-10 fixed on a neck collar (99 g, vertical downward antenna) in 1995. The transmitters represented 3.5-5.2% of goose body mass. All transmitters operated on a 84-96 s repetition period with a duty cycle of 8 h on and 16h off and were tracked using the Argos system. Six birds (all with harness attachment) were shot by hunters; 12 could not be tracked for the entire migration because of mortality, radio loss, ot radio failure; 4 (all with neck collar attachment) reached the wintering grounds. Overall, we obiained 2.4-7.2 locations/goose/day with a greater number at higher latitudes than at lower ones. In 1993, 75% of locations had a quality class (LC) ≥ 1, while only 18-20% of locations were similarly classified in 1994-1995. We could not evaluate the relative effect of the antenna orientation and the intrinsic characteristics of the transmitters on the PTT performance and location quality. The difference between true and estimated locations ranged on average between 1.4 km for LC 2 to 23 km for LC B. Geese fitted with harnesses spent more time in comfort movements than unmarked birds. We recommend that harnesses be avoided for geese. Satellite telemetry is adequate to track long-distant movements of migrants or to locate unknown critical areas (breeding, wintering, etc.) but not for detailed studies on habitat use or local movements.},

abstract={We documented extrusion and loss of abdominally implanted radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas from adult female Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus). Birds were captured during wing molt (late August to mid-September) in 1995-1997. Of 44 Harlequin Ducks implanted with radios and recaptured, 7 (16%) had lost their transmitters and 5 (11%) had radios in the process of extruding. Most (11 of 12) extrusions and losses occurred in birds implanted with radios in 1996 and recaptured in 1997. We suggest that transmitter extrusions and losses were due largely to changes in transmitter design made between 1095 and 1996. Transmitters implanted in 1996 were cylindrical rather than spherical, had a flat end with an abrupt edge, and the lower portion of the antenna was reinforced. Radio losses occurred after the 7-mo monitoring period and caused no apparent harm to the birds. Investigators using implanted radios with percutaneous antennas for long-term projects should be aware of the potential for radio extrusion and should minimize the problem by using transmitters that have no sharp edges and that are wide, rather than narrow.},

abstract={Heterogeneity in direct recovery rates is an important area of study because deductions about survival rates and hunting mortality are made from recovery data. We tested the hypothesis of condition bias in hunter-killed lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and tested differences among direct recovery rates (f = proportion of birds banded that are killed by a hunter ≤3 months after release and reported) of scaup staging on Thief Lake Wildlife Management Area (TLWMA) and Agassiz National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in northwestern Minnesota. Scaup were trapped, held for 24 hr, weighed, banded with standard aluminum leg bands, and released during 4 October-8 November 1983-86 at TLWMA, and 1984-86 at ANWR. During 1984-86, we also sprayed areas of white plumage with fluorescent paint, colorcoded by age and location. Recovery data obtained from cooperative hunters and the U.S. Geological Survey Bird Banding Laboratory were subjected to 3 sets of analyses. In an analysis of variance (ANOVA), after adjusting for sex, age, year, location of capture, and date of capture, body mass at capture of recovered birds was lower, on average, than those not recovered. Logistic regression indicated (1) probability of recovering a bird decreased with increasing body mass; (2) within years, probability of recovery increased with date of first capture; (3) scaup at TLWMA were recovered at greater rates than scaup at ANWR; (4) hatching-year (HY) scaup were recovered at greater rates than were after-hatching-year (AHY) birds; and (5) recovery was more likely during 1984-86 than in 1983. Finally, in a crude test of recovery distribution, recoveries of birds banded at ANWR were about half as likely as those banded on TLWMA to occur in Minnesota. We conclude that cohort membership (age, capture site) and condition, as measured by body mass, influence susceptibility to hunting mortality. These and other sources of heterogeneity in recovery rates should be considered when modeling survival of scaup.},

abstract={We modified a subcutaneous anchor attachment and achieved transmitter retention times that exceeded those reported previously for other attachments used on alcids. Traditional suture and epoxy attachment methods were used on Xantus' Murrelets in 1995 and 1996, while the modified attachment was used for Xantus' Murrelets in 1996 and 1997 and Marbled Murrelets in 1997. Modifications included use of an inhalant anesthetic, placing the anchor in a more cranial position on the back, application of marine epoxy, and placement of a single subcutaneous non-absorbable suture at the caudal end of the radio to hold the radio in place initially. We located 22 of 56 (39%) Xantus' Murrelets radio-marked using suture and epoxy during aerial surveys in 1995 and 1996. Of birds radio-marked using the subcutaneous anchor attachment, we located 92 of 113 (81%) Xantus' Murrelets marked in 1996 and 1997 and all 28 (100%) Marbled Murrelets marked in 1997 during aerial surveys. The maximum confirmed duration for the subcutaneous anchor transmitter attachment was 51 d for Xantus' Murrelets and 78 d for Marbled Murrelets versus 41 d for the suture and epoxy attachment used on Xantus' Murrelets. Recapture rates of radio-marked Xantus' Murrelets were similar to recapture rates of unmarked Xantus' Murrelets. Our post-release observations indicated negligible short-term physical effects from the attachment procedure, while telemetry data and examination of recaptured murrelets indicated no evidence of infection or other long-term physical effects. Breeding behavior of some murrelets was not disrupted; however, further evaluation of potential effects of this attachment technique on breeding and behavior is needed.},

abstract={The breeding population of Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) in the southeastern United States has declined since the 1930s, resulting in the listing of all United States populations of the species as endangered in 1984. We assessed genetic structure within and among nine colonies of Wood Storks from Georgia and Florida. Levels of band sharing based on multilocus oligonucleotide DNA fingerprinting of individuals from seven colonies ranged from 58% among nests within the same tree to approximately 55% within the same colony. Levels of band sharing were similar to those reported for other populations of birds that have experienced drastic reductions in population size. A more thorough analysis of four polymorphic microsatellite loci for 136 individuals from nine colonies indicated low levels of allelic diversity and low genetic divergence among colonies. Genetic differentiation (P(ST) = 0.015) was similar to levels detected from allozymes for 15 colonies of Wood Storks in Florida:=(P(ST) = 0.019). These data, together with demographic studies of these populations, indicated high levels of gene flow among colonies (N(m) = 16.4). In agreement with previous studies, we recommend that all colonies of Wood Storks in the southeastern United States be managed on a regional basis as a single interbreeding population. Similar genetic surveys of the disjunct breeding populations of Wood Storks in South America and Central America would be beneficial in understanding the total genetic differentiation in the species.},

abstract={We simultaneously monitored the heart rate and behavior of nine free-living Greater White-fronted Geese (Anser albifrons) on their wintering grounds in northern California. Heart rates of wild geese were monitored via abdominally-implanted radio transmitters with electrodes that received electrical impulses of the heart and emitted a radio signal with each ventricular contraction. Post-operative birds appeared to behave normally, readily rejoining flocks and flying up to 15 km daily from night-time roost sites to feed in surrounding agricultural fields. Heart rates varied significantly among individuals and among behaviors, and ranged from less than 100 beats per minute (BPM) during resting, to over 400 BPM during flight. Heart rates varied from 80 to 140 BPM during non-strenuous activities such as walking, feeding, and maintenance activities, to about 180 BPM when birds became alert, and over 400 BPM when birds were startled, even if they did not take flight. Postflight heart rate recovery time averaged < 10 sec. During agonistic encounters, heart rate exceeded 400 BPM; heart rates during social interactions were not predictable solely from postures, as heart rates were context-dependent, and were highest in initial encounters among individuals. Instantaneous measures of physiological parameters, such as heart rate, are often better indicators of the degree of response to external stimuli than visual observations and can be used to improve estimates of energy expenditure based solely on activity data.},

abstract={The purpose of our study was to assess the influence of moonlight on the foraging behaviour of Australian Owlet-nightjars (Aegotheles cristatus), an Australasian caprimulgiform bird. Australian Owlet-nightjars should face a distinct tradeoff between increasing activity during moonlit nights to enhance foraging, while at the same time risking increased exposure to visually- oriented nocturnal predators. Our objectives were to quantify foraging activity in relation to moonlight using radio telemetry and document the principal foraging strategy of Australian Owlet-nightjars by observing light-tagged, free-ranging birds. Our results showed that like true nightjars, Australian Owlet-nightjars are almost exclusively sally-type foragers and rarely forage on the ground. They suffer high rates of predation relative to other adult caprimulgiforms and are active almost exclusively during true night. Overall, activity levels inferred from telemetry data declined over the course of the study (September-March), although this effect was overridden on full moon nights when there was no seasonal effect and activity levels remained constant. Unlike true nightjars for whom bright lunar light enhances foraging activity, our results for Australian Owlet-nightjars suggest that the risk of predation influences foraging activity, especially on full moon nights. Although Australian Owlet-nightjars apparently employ the same foraging mode as nightjars do, knowledge about foraging strategy alone is apparently insufficient to predict the bird's response to lunar condition. More data on activity at different times of the year combined with measurements of prey availability and information on the timing and identity of predators are needed to allow a definitive explanation for the influence of lunar light on these birds.},

Although parentage patterns have not been examined in this socially monogamous species, behavioral observations have suggested that extrapair fertilizations (EPFs) occur. Using multilocus DNA fingerprinting, we determined parentage of 125 offspring in 38 broods. EPFs were present in 17 broods (44.7%) and included 34 offspring (27.2%) over both years. We found no evidence of intraspecific brood parasitism, because all offspring had high band-sharing scores with their social mothers. Frequencies of EPFs did not differ significantly between years (although only two years were examined). There was also no significant effect of time of season, age of social parents, population levels of breeding synchrony, or breeding density upon frequency or presence of EPFs within broods. In contrast, the occurrence of EPFs was strongly and positively associated with breeding synchrony among neighboring females; nests in areas of high local synchrony were more likely to contain extrapair young. Univariate logistic regression indicated that the level of local synchrony accounted for 22% of the variance in probability of EPF. These results suggest that the temporal and spatial concentration of fertile females are important in influencing the prevalence of EPFs.},

Fidelity to wind direction was confirmed, and numbers of bagworms ballooning from 3.05 m to 36.58 m was measured, with Tanglefoot® traps mounted on metal fence posts. Ballooning numbers were satisfactorily described with a negative exponential model incorporating both gravitational and trap losses. NO significant difference was found between ballooning distances achieved by larvae with and without early-stage bags. A study of infestation levels on ornamental junipers planted around houses on the north and south sides of east-west streets revealed both a strong front- vs. backyard difference, and a weaker but statistically significant side-of-street effect. Patterns reflecting short-range dispersal were found in a linear windbreak planting of northern white cedar (Thuja occidentalis), and in a 12 X 44 = 528-tree lattice of planted junipers (near Urbana, Illinois). A 'bonfire' effect showing heaviest infestations in mid-lattice, and reduced infestations on the periphery (especially on the windward edge) was postulated and confirmed. Studies of the effect of increased 'target' size of larger trees, and of the incidence of apparent bird and small mammal predation, are also reported.},

We PTT-tagged 42 female peregrines from 2 breeding areas (upper Yukon River in eastcentral Alaska and Lake Powell on the Colorado Plateau in southern Utah and northern Arizona) late in the breeding seasons of 1993-95. Only 2 of the PTTs failed prematurely (4.7% failure rate). Active PTTs (i.e., PTTs on live birds that eventually stopped transmitting due to battery exhaustion) averaged 280 transmission hours for 1993-94 (n = 3), 380 transmission hours for 1994-95 (n = 7), and 430 transmission hours for 1995-96 (n = 15). Using an estimate of maximum ground speed of peregrines (104 km/hr) based on empirical observations and aerodynamic calculations, we determined that 4.48% of all locations provided to us by Argos (n = 2,323) were biologically implausible. We also received many poor-quality locations (68% of records were in Argos location classes 0, A, and B) typical of small, relatively underpowered PTTs. To estimate location accuracy of these poor-quality locations, we compared Argos-estimated locations with known locations of 11 rock doves (Columba livia) tagged with PTTs. The location types with the highest precision averaged 4 km from the true location, while the location types with the lowest precision averaged 35 km from the true location. These results indicate the PTT locations were sufficient to document animal movements over broad spatial scales such as identifying migration routes and nonbreeding areas of birds. This technology is more efficient and less biased than the current approaches used to obtain this information (mark-resighting of banded animals or standard radiotelemetry techniques). However, the PTTs currently available are not suitable when position accuracy <35 km is needed.},

abstract={The Montserrat Oriole Icterus oberi is endemic to the Caribbean island of Montserrat where, prior to 1995, it was widely distributed across the island's three main interior mountain ranges: the Centre, Soufriere and South Soufriere Hills. In July 1995, a long-dormant volcano on Chances Peak in the Soufriere Hills began to erupt. Since then the forest habitat of the oriole on the Soufriere and South Soufriere Hills has been devastated by pyroclastic flows and surges, heavy ash eruptions and rock falls. The Montserrat Oriole populations that inhabited these two mountain ranges have probably been lost. In December 1997, a census of the remaining Centre Hills population was undertaken to assess its status in the face of the heavy ash fall that occurred earlier the same year. To do this, a systematic grid of 140 sample points was overlaid on an area of 1,437·5 ha encompassing the Centre Hills, and a 10-minute count of all bird species was undertaken at 137 of these points during an eight-day survey period. The distance from the point to each oriole detected was measured and records of all other species were allocated to one of five distance bands radiating out from the point. Distance sampling was used to model densities, and thus to estimate population sizes, of eight bird species in the study area. It was estimated that 4,000 (95% CIs 1,500-7,800) Montserrat Orioles remain in the Centre Hills and thus the world. Although the probability of pyroclastic flows and surges overrunning the Centre Hills is considered remote, it is recommended that the Montserrat Oriole be classified as Globally Threatened (Endangered) under the revised IUCN threat categories because of its loss of breeding habitat since 1995.},

abstract={Lesser Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) have nested on Akimiski Island in James Bay, Northwest Territories, Canada, since at least 1958. Nesting was intermittent until 1967, but annual after 1968. The number of nesting birds present through 1974 was usually less than 200 pairs, but has since increased tenfold. In 1994, 2218 flightless adults with 2590 goslings were present in early August, indicating about 1100 nesting pairs. In 1995, 1996, and 1997, respectively, there were an estimated 1008, 1917, and 1725 nests. Periodic dramatic increases in numbers of nesting pairs cannot be explained by recruitment alone, suggesting that immigrants, presumably delayed migrant birds from more northern colonies, remained to nest on the island. They and/or their progeny apparently developed longer term nesting affinity for the island. Both the proportion of blue morph geese, which averaged 79.6% over 39 years, and leg band recovery distribution attest to a close relationship with Cape Henrietta Maria, Ontario, and Baffin Island, Northwest Territories, nesting colonies.},

At least 50% of all marked birds were detected on Mono Lake, and data collected in mid-October suggested that this proportion was consistent across years. These observations largely confirm a fall migration pattern that had been previously based on leg-band returns. Radio-tracking also confirmed that some movement occurred between Mono Lake and Salton Sea. In terms of the number of marked birds detected, the internal antenna-type transmitter produced superior results over other (attachment) protocols but their short range (<2 km) means that they will be effective only at sites where the birds are both abundant and concentrated such as Mono Lake, Great Salt Lake, and Salton Sea.},

abstract={Neck bands are a widely used marker in goose research. However, few studies have investigated a possible negative effect of this marker on survival. We tested the effect of neck bands on the survival of adult female greater snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) by marking birds with either a neck band and a metal leg band or a leg band only on Bylot Island (Nunavut, formerly included in the Northwest Territories, Canada) from 1990 to 1996. Annual survival was estimated using leg-band recoveries in fall and winter and using neck-band sightings in spring and fall. Recapture rates were estimated using summer recaptures. Using recovery data, the selected model yielded a survival similar for the neck-banded and leg-banded only birds (S = 0.845 ± 0.070 vs. S = 0.811 ± 0.107). The hypothesis of equality of survival between the 2 groups was easily accepted under most constraints imposed on survival or recovery rates. However, failure to account for a different direct recovery rate for neck-banded birds would lead us to incorrectly conclude a possible negative effect of neck bands on survival. Using sighting data, mean annual survival of neck-banded birds was independently estimated at 0.833 ± 0.057, a value very similar to that estimated with band-recovery analysis. Raw recapture rates during summer were significantly lower for neck-banded birds compared to those marked with leg bands only (4.6% vs. 12.1%), but in this analysis, survival, site fidelity, reproductive status, and recapture rates were confounded. We conclude that neck bands did not affect survival of greater snow geese, but could possibly affect other demographic traits such as breeding propensity and emigration.},

Despite concerns about their negative impacts, few studies have employed designs capable of clearly demonstrating these effects. During a 1993-98 study of emperor geese (Chen canagica), we contrasted survival and reproduction of geese marked with tarsal bands to those marked with either small neck collars, large neck collars, or small neck collars with attached radiotransmitters. Annual survival of adult females marked with tarsal bands varied among years and averaged 0.807 ± 0.140 (v̄ ± SE). Survival of geese with other types of markers also varied among years but was lower (0.640 ± 0.198). Collars with radiotransmitters lowered breeding propensity, as indexed by resighting rates. Although clutch sizes of tarsal banded birds were similar to those for unmarked birds, other markers reduced clutch sizes by about 1 egg. Egg mass and hatch date were not affected by marker type. Future studies of goose demographics should seriously consider use of alternative markers.},

abstract={Wetlands in the western Great Basin of the United States are patchily distributed and undergo extensive seasonal and annual variation in water levels. The American Avocet (Recurvirostra americana) is one of many shorebird species that use these wetlands as breeding and migratory stopover sites and must adjust to variable conditions. We used radio telemetry to determine postbreeding, premigratory movement patterns of avocets throughout the region. In 1996 and 1997, 185 breeding adults were captured and fitted with radio transmitters at five breeding areas in Oregon, California, and Nevada. Regular aerial and ground surveys were conducted at the five main study areas from June through September, or until all avocets had left a site. Other wetlands in the western Great Basin also were surveyed by aircraft for the presence of radio-marked birds. Fifty-six percent of radio-marked avocets were still detected in the region at least eight weeks after capture. Each of these individuals was detected at an average of 2.1 lakes (range 0 to 6), with 74% found at more than one lake system. Forty radio-marked individuals moved at least 200 km between wetlands prior to migration, most of which dispersed northward. Male and female patterns did not differ significantly. Overall, movements may be associated with a prebasic molt, exploitation of a superabundant food source in northern lakes, and reconnaissance for future breeding efforts or staging sites. These results also demonstrate wide-ranging patterns of dispersal in this species and suggest a need for the consideration of large-scale habitat connectivity issues in establishing conservation strategies for shorebirds in the western Great Basin.},

Day of capture and condition at date of capture were not predictive of survival. Survival rates were similar across ages and years except for lower survival of juvenile birds during 1993-94. The overall survival rate for the period 1 December to 15 February (77 days) was 72 ± 5%, which was the same or higher than reported elsewhere in winter. Hunting mortality varied from 1.6 to 12.2%, which seemed relatively low given the ample public hunting opportunity and a high winter-long fidelity to the study area.},

To estimate hornbill contribution to a particular tree species' seed shadow we combined data from movements, determined by radio-tracking, with data from seed passage trials. For 13 individuals tracked over 12 months, home range varied between 925 and 4,472 ha, a much larger area than reported for other African avian frugivores. Seed passage times ranged from 51 to 765 min, with C. atrata showing longer passage times than C. cylindricus, and larger seeds having longer gut retention times than smaller seeds. Combining these data, we estimated that seed shadows were extensive for the eight tree species examined, with approximately 80% of seeds moved more than 500 m from the parent plant. Maximum estimated dispersal distances for larger seeds were 6,919 and 3,558 m for C. atrata and C. cylindricus, respectively. The extent of hornbill seed shadows suggests that their influence in determining forest structure will likely increase as other larger mammalian dispersers are exterminated.},

abstract={Heart rate, occurrence of apnea, body temperature, quality of anesthesia and nest abandonment were compared during either propofol or isoflurane anesthesia of nesting female canvasback ducks (Aythya valisineria) at 15 to 18 days of incubation. One hundred eighteen canvasbacks were assigned randomly to three treatments so that nest abandonment could be compared among treatments from May to July 1995 and 1996. Sterile dummy silicone implants were placed during an abdominal laparotomy while ducks were anesthetized with either propofol or isoflurane, or ducks were flushed from the nest but not captured (control). Propofol was delivered through an intravenous catheter, while isoflurane was delivered in oxygen. Propofol provided smooth, rapid induction and recovery, whereas ducks recovering from isoflurane tended to struggle. At the nest, ducks in the propofol group were given additional boluses until they were lightly anesthetized, whereas birds that received isoflurane were released. All birds survived surgery but one death occurred prior to surgery in 1995 using propofol during a period without ventilation and monitoring. Adequate artificial ventilation is recommended to prevent complications. Heart rate declined significantly in both years during isoflurane anesthesia and in 1995 during propofol anesthesia but not 1996. During both isoflurane and propofol anesthesia, body temperature declined significantly over time. Nest abandonment was significantly different among treatments and occurred in all treatment groups in both years, but propofol (15%) and control groups (8%) had lower than expected abandonment compared to isoflurane (28%). Propofol offers several advantages over isoflurane for field use; equipment is easily portable, lower anesthetic cost, and ambient temperature does not alter physical characteristics of the drug. Advantages over isoflurane, including lower nest abandonment following intraabdominal radio transmitter placement, make propofol a good anesthetic choice for field studies.},

abstract={Movement is a fundamental feature of vertebrate behavior and can modify process within populations and communities. Because tropical avian frugivores disperse seeds of many plant species, the temporal and spatial patterning of their movement will influence seed distribution within a habitat. To date, little is known about movement patterns of these birds. Here we consider the movement of an understory frugivore, Mionectes oleagineus. Movements of 16 non-breeding females were monitored using continuous radio-telemetry to provide a general description of movement patterns and to examine the fractal geometry of the spatial component of movement. Most movements were of short distance and duration, with the frequency distributions of both measures strongly skewed to the left. Over the range of measurement scales considered, the fractal dimension of M. oleagineus's movement increased with increasing measurement scale up to ca. 100 m. whereafter it appeared to flatten out. We combined movement data with M. oleagineus gut-passage rates for seeds of six plant species to predict seed shadows. Estimated seed shadows were leptokurtic for four of the six plant species, with median dispersal distances for all species from 42 to 56 m. Dispersal distances were of the order of reported pollen dispersal distances, suggesting that even small seed dispersers like M. oleagineus can provide significant dispersal for plant genotypes. Gut passage rate appears to determine the shape of the seed shadow, while movement determines dispersal scale.},

abstract={I used mark-recapture analysis and radio telemetry to characterize winter movement patterns of six grassland sparrows in southeastern Arizona. Mark-recapture data were generated by banding birds captured during repeated flush-netting sessions conducted on a series of 7-ha plots over three consecutive winters. This resulted in 2,641 captures of 2,006 individual sparrows of the six species. Radio telemetry was conducted concurrently on 20 individuals of four of these species. Recapture data and radio telemetry indicated that Cassin's Sparrow (Aimophila cassinii) and Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) were the most sedentary, followed by Baird's Sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii), Vesper Sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus), Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), and Brewer's Sparrow (Spizella breweri). Grasshopper, Baird's, Savannah, and Vesper sparrows tended to remain within fixed home ranges during winter. With the exception of Savannah Sparrows, whose movement behavior varied among study sites, movement patterns remained constant within species across years and study sites despite radical fluctuations in the absolute and relative abundances of all species. Interspecific differences in movement pattern suggest that species in this system partition niche space according to the regional-coexistence mechanism. Abundances of the most sedentary species, Cassin's, Grasshopper, and Baird's sparrows, were poorly or negatively correlated with summer rainfall at the between-year landscape scale, whereas abundances of the more mobile Savannah, Vesper, and Brewer's sparrows were strongly positively correlated. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction that movement constrains large-scale habitat selection, favoring mobile species in fragmented environments.},

abstract={We report on the first deployment of satellite transmitters in large alcids. In 1995 and 1996, we surgically implanted 51 transmitters in Common and Thick-billed murres (Uria aalge and U. lomvia) and Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) at three colonies in Alaska. These devices furnished more than 2,900 locations over succeeding months (eight months maximum transmitter life), some 30-40% of which had calculated errors of <1,000 m. We considered other data to be reliable if locations were repetitive within a short period of time. As measures of data collection efficiency, we calculated location indices (number of locations per hour of transmission) of 0.44 during the breeding season and 0.35 overall. Those values compared favorably with satellite transmitters previously deployed on large mammals at similar latitudes. Transmitters did not last as long as expected because lithium batteries tended to self-discharge when kept at the high internal temperature of a bird. Most importantly, we encountered high mortality of instrumented birds, especially in the interval from 11-20 days after release. Our results suggest that radio transmission itself somehow impaired normal feeding behavior or otherwise compromised the birds' health. Those two problems (battery life and bird mortality) will need to be solved before implantable devices can be applied effectively to the same or similar species in the future.

abstract={Unbiased estimates of survival based on individuals outfitted with radiotransmitters require meeting the assumptions that radios do not affect survival, and animals for which the radio signal is lost have the same survival probability as those for which fate is known. In most survival studies, researchers have made these assumptions without testing their validity. We tested these assumptions by comparing interannual recapture rates (and, by inference, survival) between radioed and unradioed adult female harlequin ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus), and for radioed females, between right-censored birds (i.e., those for which the radio signal was lost during the telemetry monitoring period) and birds with known fates. We found that recapture rates of birds equipped with implanted radiotransmitters (21.6 ± 3.0%; x̄ ± SE) were similar to unradioed birds (21.7 ± 8.6%), suggesting that radios did not affect survival. Recapture rates also were similar between right-censored (20.6 ± 5.1%) and known-fate individuals (22.1 ± 3.8%), suggesting that missing birds were not subject to differential mortality. We also determined that capture and handling resulted in short-term loss of body mass for both radioed and unradioed females and that this effect was more pronounced for radioed birds (the difference between groups was 15.4 ± 7.1 g). However, no difference existed in body mass after recapture 1 year later. Our study suggests that implanted radios are an unbiased method for estimating survival of harlequin ducks and likely other species under similar circumstances.},

abstract={We tracked the movements of Common Murres (Uria aalge), Thick-billed Murres (U. lomvia), and Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) using surgically implanted satellite transmitters. From 1994-1996, we tagged 53 birds from two colonies in the Gulf of Alaska (Middleton Island and Barren Islands) and two colonies in the Chukchi Sea (Cape Thompson and Cape Lisburne). Murres and puffins ranged 100 km or farther from all colonies in summer, but most instrumented birds had abandoned breeding attempts and their movements likely differed from those of actively breeding birds. However, murres whose movements in the breeding period suggested they still had chicks to feed foraged repeatedly at distances of 50-80 km from the Chukchi colonies in 1995. We detected no differences in the foraging patterns of males and females during the breeding season, nor between Thick-billed and Common Murres from mixed colonies. Upon chick departure from the northern colonies, male murres - some believed to be tending their flightless young - rifted with prevailing currents toward Siberia, whereas most females flew directly South toward the Bering Sea. Murres from Cape Thompson and Cape Lisburne shared a common wintering area in the southeastern Bering Sea in 1995, and birds from Cape Lisburne returned to the same area in the winter of 1996. We conclude that differences in foraging conditions during summer rather than differential mortality rates in winter account for contrasting population trends previously documented in those two colonies.},

We used mist-netting to study site fidelity on four 9-ha plots within and among years. We used radio-telemetry to measure Hermit Thrushes' movements and territoriality (n = 50). We found that Hermit Thrushes saturated suitable patches within the study area. Most Hermit Thrushes actively defended small [mean = 0.55 ± 0.03 (SE) ha], minimally overlapping (15.90 ± 3.63%) territories throughout the winter. Hermit Thrushes established and maintained territories using the same agonistic behaviors described for breeding birds. A few non-territorial birds (14%) moved among occupied territories, but most were faithful to a larger neighborhood, apparently awaiting a territory vacancy. Territorial behavior and frequency of non-territorial birds did not differ among age and sex classes, suggesting the absence of a sex- or age-based dominance hierarchy. The behavior of Hermit Thrushes conformed to the emerging view that competition for spatially mediated resources on the wintering grounds, such as food or cover, contribute to limiting populations of many species of migrant passerines.},

abstract={Radiotelemetry is frequently used for research on waterfowl, but some transmitter designs alter reproductive effort, behavior, and mass of birds. Quantitative comparisons of transmitter effects are needed so researchers can use instruments least likely to generate biased results. We compared body mass and behavior of captive blue-winged teal (Anas discors) females fitted with either a backpack-harness transmitter, abdominally implanted device, or no radio over a 12-week period. Females with implants lost mass during the first week following surgery, while backpack-marked and control birds gained mass (P = 0.02). Mass of implanted birds recovered by the second week after surgery, and never differed among treatment groups over the subsequent 11 weeks (P ≥ 0.51). Females with backpack transmitters spent more time on comfort movements (P < 0.001) and less time in water (P < 0.001) than did birds with implants or no radios. We found no difference among the treatments in time spent resting (P ≥ 0.18), feeding (P ≥ 0.10), or on locomotion (P ≥ 0.18), except that backpack-marked females spent less time engaged in locomotion than did implanted females (P = 0.03). Our results corroborate previous studies showing effects of backpack-harness transmitters on behavior. We demonstrated that implants do not affect behavior, but are associated with a temporary post-surgical loss of mass. The alteration of behavior caused by backpack transmitters did not diminish with time, so researchers should not assume that an adjustment period is sufficient to eliminate transmitter effects.},

abstract={Biologists often estimate separate survival and movement rates from radiotelemetry and mark-recapture data from the same study population. We describe a method for combining these data types in a single model to obtain joint, potentially less biased estimates of survival and movement that use all available data. We furnish an example using wood thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina) captured at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge in Central Georgia in 1996. The model structure allows estimation of survival and capture probabilities, as well as estimation of movements away from and into the study area. In addition, the model structure provides many possibilities for hypothesis testing. Using the combined model structure, we estimated that weekly survival of wood thrushes was 0.989 ± 0.007 (±SE). Survival rates of banded and radiomarked individuals were not different (α[S(radioed), S(banded)] = log[S(radioed)/S(banded)] = 0.0239, 95% CI = -0.0196 to 0.0486). Fidelity rates (weekly probability of remaining in a stratum) did not differ between geographic strata (ψ = 0.911 ± 0.020; α[ψ, ψ22] = 0.0161, 95% CI = -0.0309 to 0.0631), and recapture rates (p = 0.097 ± 0.016) of banded and radiomarked individuals were not different (α[p(radioed), P(banded)] = 0.145, 95% CI = -0.510 to 0.800). Combining these data types in a common model resulted in more precise estimates of movement and recapture rates than separate estimation, but ability to detect stratum or mark-specific differences in parameters was weak. We conducted simulation trials to investigate the effects of varying study designs on parameter accuracy and statistical power to detect important differences. Parameter accuracy was high (relative bias [RBIAS] &lt;2%) and confidence interval coverage close to nominal, except for survival estimates of banded birds for the 'off study area' stratum, which were negatively biased (RBIAS -7 to -15%) when sample sizes were small (5-10 banded or radioed animals 'released' per time interval). To provide adequate data for useful inference from this model, study designs should seek a minimum of 25 animals of each marking type observed (marked or observed via telemetry) in each time period and geographic stratum.},

abstract={Harlequin duck (Histrionicus histrionicus) life-history characteristics make their populations particularly vulnerable to perturbations during nonbreeding periods. The 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill was a major perturbation to nonbreeding habitats of harlequin ducks in Prince William Sound, Alaska, which resulted in population injury. To assess the status of population recovery from the oil spill and to evaluate factors potentially constraining full recovery, we used radiotelemetry to examine survival of adult female harlequin ducks during winters of 1995-96, 1996-97, and 1997-98. We implanted 294 harlequin ducks (154 and 140 in oiled and unoiled areas, respectively) with transmitters and tracked their signals from aircraft during October through March. We examined variation in survival rates relative to area and season (early, mid, and late winter) through comparisons of models using Akaike's information criterion (AIC(c)) values. The 3 models best supported by the data indicated that survival of birds in oiled areas was lower than in unoiled areas. Inclusion of standardized body mass during wing molt in the 3 best models did not improve their fit, indicating that body mass during wing molt did not affect subsequent winter survival. In the model that best fit our data, survival was high in early winter for both areas, lower during mid and late winter seasons, and lowest in oiled areas during mid winter. Cumulative winter survival estimated from this model was 78.0% (SE = 3.3%) in oiled areas and 83.7% (SE = 2.9%) in unoiled areas. We determined that area differences in survival were more likely related to oiling history than intrinsic geographic differences. Based on a demographic model, area differences in survival offer a likely mechanism for observed declines in populations on oiled areas. Concurrent studies indicated that harlequin ducks continued to be exposed to residual Exxon Valdez oil as much as 9 years after the spill. We suggest that oil exposure, mortality, and population dynamics were linked and conclude that continued effects of the oil spill likely restricted recovery of harlequin duck populations through at least 1998.},

abstract={We analyzed 2426 records of recoveries of banded House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) to identify wintering sites of individuals coming from different parts of this species' broad North American breeding range. Records suggest that most birds breeding approximately east of the Appalachian Mountains (n = 6) winter in the far southeastern United States, especially Florida. In contrast, birds breeding west of the Appalachian Mountains (n = 23) into the eastern Great Plains may winter anywhere from South Carolina and Florida west into Texas. It also appears that individuals from the same breeding populations winter in different sites. The few recoveries (n = 4) of birds from breeding sites on the western Great Plains indicate that at least some individuals from this region travel not due south but rather southeast during migration and winter in the eastern half of the southern U.S. No long-distance recoveries have been made of birds from breeding in or west of the Rocky Mountains.},

abstract={Accurate estimation of survival probabilities is an important component of population demographics, and it permits a test of the life-history prediction that densities influence population dynamics via suppression of survival rates. As part of a long-term study of urban-nesting Merlins (Falco columbarius), we estimated survival rates and tested for the effects of density dependence based on capture histories from 1,354 individuals (43 males and 110 females caught for the first time as adult breeding birds, and 597 males and 604 females caught for the first time as locally produced nestlings). Overall capture probabilities were 0.55 ± SD of 0.039 per year for adults, 0.10 ± 0.075 per year for juvenile males, and 0.58 ± 0.23 per year for juvenile females. Mean survival rate of adults was 0.62 ± 0.11 per year and did not differ significantly between males and females. Overall juvenile survival rates were 0.23 ± 0.032 for males and 0.055 ± 0.012 for females. Band returns suggest that the discrepancy in survival rates between juvenile males and females resulted from higher natal dispersal of females rather than from lower survival. Survival of adults (but not juveniles) was negatively density dependent, suggesting that density-dependent declines in survival exerted a regulatory effect on population size.},

abstract={Several studies have suggested that ducks in poor condition are more likely to be captured for banding or recovered by hunters than those in good condition (condition-bias hypothesis). We tested the hypotheses that samples of greater snow geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica) captured with baited cannon-nets, and shot by hunters in fall at the Cap Tourmente National Wildlife Area, Quebec, were not biased toward birds in poor condition. Density of birds and the frequency of aggressive interactions at baited capture sites were higher than at unbaited sites. Overall, condition indices of geese captured in baited and unbaited cannon-nets did not differ for both adults and juveniles. Even though geese caught with cannon-nets may be a heterogeneous sample, we argue that they are nonetheless representative of the population with respect to body condition and social status. Mean condition indices of juveniles captured with cannon-nets did not differ from those shot by hunters, but adults shot by hunters were on average heavier than those captured. There was no difference in mass of abdominal fat between geese captured with cannon-nets and those shot by hunters. We used body mass corrected for structural size and recovery data from 2,242 geese banded during October 1993-95 at Cap Tourmente to test whether geese in poor condition at the time of banding had a higher probability of being recovered by hunters. Among 12 separate analyses (by year, sex, and age), only 2 revealed a significant negative relationship (juvenile males and females in 1995) between condition of banded birds and recovery rate. We conclude that our results provided little evidence that greater snow geese captured at baited cannon-nets or shot by hunters were biased toward birds in poor condition.},

abstract={Many state natural resource agencies release ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) for hunting, but the effectiveness of these programs has never been evaluated on a statewide basis. We conducted a reward-band study to estimate harvest, reporting, and survival rates of pheasants raised and released by the Pennsylvania Game Commission (PGC) for the fall 1998 hunting season. We banded 6,770 of 199,613 released pheasants with leg bands worth $0-$400. Rewards >$75 produced 100% reporting rates. Hunters reported 71.0% of harvested pheasants banded with standard bands (no reward). Cocks had an estimated 62.3% harvest rate when released on public land and a 46.8% harvest rate on private land. Hens had an estimated 50.4% harvest rate when released on public land and a 31.1% harvest rate on private land. Estimated harvest rate for hen pheasants released in September in the either-sex zone was 15.5%. In the late season, pheasants released on public land had a 33.6% harvest rate and a 23.5% harvest rate on private land. We found that few pheasants (<6%) survived >30 days and birds released on public land had reduced survival rates primarily because of greater harvest rates. In fiscal year 1998-99, the net cost to raise and release 199,613 pheasants was $2,813,138 ($14.09 per bird). The average cost per harvested pheasant was $29.10, but ranged from $22.63 to $90.74 depending on the date and location of release. We estimated that 49.9% (82,017 birds) of pheasants stocked immediately prior to and during the regular and late seasons (excluding September releases of hens) were harvested by hunters. Percentage of pheasants harvested by hunters could be increased by expanding the either-sex zone in Pennsylvania so that more hens could be legally killed by hunters and by allocating releases to seasons and locations with greater harvest rates. However, before such changes are implemented, we recommend a survey of Pennsylvania pheasant hunters to ascertain their opinions and desires regarding releases of game-farm pheasants.},

For nine colors (yellow, orange, red, green, light blue, dark bine, black, pink, and white) analyzed separately, returning or breeding birds did not carry a particular color more often than expected. The use of colored leg bands in this breeding population did not appear to affect return or breeding frequencies of birds wearing at least one of a particular colored leg band.

abstract={The Brown-headed Cowbird (Molothrus ater) is a widespread brood parasite which often engages in a commensalistic feeding relationship with domestic livestock. We studied the behavior of female cowbirds breeding in pinyon-juniper woodlands in New Mexico, USA, on two adjacent sites, one an active cattle ranch, and the other a site that was not grazed by domestic livestock throughout the songbird breeding season. In 1994, we conducted morning and afternoon surveys of cowbird abundance in pinyon-juniper and prairie habitats; from 1995 to 1997 we used radio telemetry to monitor daily and seasonal movement and behavioral patterns of female cowbirds. Our objectives were to measure how closely cowbird feeding behavior was linked to livestock grazing, and how the presence or absence of active livestock grazing within a female's breeding range influenced diurnal patterns of behavior. During morning surveys, we detected cowbirds primarily in pinyon-juniper habitat, but in similar numbers in the ungrazed and actively grazed woodlands. In the.afternoon, we detected cowbirds feeding almost exclusively in actively grazed prairies but found that they deserted those sites when cattle were removed in early July. Radio telemetry confirmed that individual females were commuting daily between these habitats. Females (n=30) were generally located in pinyon-juniper habitats from 0500 to ∼1200, presumably breeding. Females that bred within actively grazed pinyon-juniper habitat often fed on the ground with livestock on their morning ranges, while those breeding in ungrazed habitat did not. In total, 98% of cowbird feeding observations occurred with livestock. Although most females commuted <3 km between breeding and feeding ranges, some individuals with breeding ranges located toward the center of the ungrazed property averaged 7.7 km. When cattle were rotated out of the main feeding pasture in early July, females immediately extended their commutes by ∼1.2 km to access remaining actively grazed pastures. Overall home range sizes were large (160-4344 ha) and tended to increase with distance between the females' breeding range and active livestock grazing. This increase was reflected mainly by differences in feeding range sizes rather than breeding range sizes. The observed link between cowbird behavior and the distribution of livestock suggests that in regions where livestock grazing is the dominant land use, manipulations of livestock grazing patterns may provide an effective tool to manage cowbird parasitism.},

abstract={With the development of small implantable data loggers and externally attached temperature-sensitive radio transmitters, increasing attention is being paid to determining the thermoregulatory strategies of free-ranging birds and mammals. One of the constraints of such studies is that without a direct measure of metabolic rate, it is difficult to determine the significance of lowered body temperatures. We surveyed the literature and found that many different definitions have been used to discriminate torpor from normothermy. Many studies use arbitrary temperature thresholds without regard for the normothermic body temperature of the individuals or species involved. This variation makes comparison among studies difficult and means that ecologically and energetically significant small reductions in body temperature may be overlooked. We suggest that normothermic body temperature for each individual animal should be determined and that torpor be defined as occurring when the body temperature drops below that level. When individuals' active temperatures are not available, a species-specific value should be used. Of greater value, however, are the depth and duration of torpor bouts. We suggest several advantages of this definition over those used in the past.},

Mean concentration of DDE was greater in eggs than all other tissues, with individual samples ranging from 0.24 to 8.12 μg/kg. In general, concentrations of DDT in soil were effective in describing the variation of contaminants in adipose samples.

abstract={Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and scaled quail (Callipepla squamata) populations have declined throughout most of their distribution, and these declines have become more dramatic in recent years. In this review, we examine the role of predation in quail management. Predation is the major source of nest loss and of mortality for young and adult quail. Mean nest success across studies reviewed was 28%. Estimates of annual survival rates have varied from 5 to 26% for radiotelemetry studies and from 15 to 30% based on age-ratio studies. Breeding season survival estimates ranged from 13 to 51% in telemetry studies reviewed. Brood survival is the least studied aspect of quail survival; estimates ranged from 13 to 47%. Mammalian predators most often implicated in nest predation include striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), raccoons (Procyon lotor), opossums (Didelphis virginianus), foxes (Urocyon cinereoargenteus and Vulpes vulpes), coyotes (Canis latrans), and feral hogs (Sus scrofa). Accipiters (Accipiter spp.) and northern harriers (Circus cyaneus) are the most common avian predators of quail. Less information is available to assess impact of predation on scaled quail, but observations from areas where bobwhites and scaled quail are sympatric suggested that scaled quail are less vulnerable to predation than bobwhites. Although quail have adapted to cope with high predation rates (e.g., renesting, large clutches), populations in some areas may be suppressed by predation. Changes in land use, management practices, and predator communities interact to depress quail populations over much of the bobwhite's range. Additional studies are needed to assess the role of predation and predation management in light of these landscape-level changes. A variation of the Integrated Pest Management philosophy used in crop production is proposed as an appropriate model to address predation management for quail.},

abstract={Satellite telemetry was used to determine fall migratory movements of Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) breeding in the United States. Study areas were established along the lower Columbia River between Oregon and Washington; in north-central Minnesota; on Shelter Island, New York; and in southern New Jersey. Seventy-four adults (25 males, 49 females) were tracked from 1995 through 1999. Migration routes differed among populations but not by sex. Western Ospreys migrated through California and to a lesser degree other western states and wintered in Mexico (88%), El Salvador (6%), and Honduras (6%) (25.9°N to 13.0°N and 108.3°W to 87.3°W). Minnesota Ospreys migrated along three routes: (1) through the Central U.S. and then along the east coast of Mexico, (2) along the Mississippi River Valley, then across the Gulf of Mexico, or (3) through the southeastern U.S., then across the Caribbean. East Coast birds migrated along the eastern seaboard of the U.S., through Florida, and across the Caribbean. Midwestern birds wintered from Mexico south to Bolivia (22.35°N to 13.64°S, and 91.75°W to 61.76°W), while East Coast birds wintered from Florida to as far south as Brazil (27.48°N to 18.5°S and 80.4°W to 57.29°W). Dates of departure from breeding areas differed significantly between sexes and geographic regions, with females leaving earlier than males. Western birds traveled a shorter distance than either midwestern or eastern Ospreys. Females traveled farther than males from the same population, which resulted in females typically wintering south of males.},

abstract={Numerous studies document nest-site philopatry in wood ducks (Aix sponsa). Such behavior should promote unique genetic structure among breeding populations. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing restriction site variation in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of 218 nesting wood duck hens. We tested the utility, of mtDNA variation in identifying migrants from a sample of 92 wood ducks harvested by duck hunters. Genetic variation was found only in the cytochrome b gene. Statistically significant genetic structure existed among 8 breeding populations, but was a function of haplotype frequencies in 1 population that differed from the other 7. Restriction enzyme digestion revealed 2 haplotypes common to all populations and 3 rare haplotypes. Haplotype diversity within populations was low with respect to other avian studies. Direct sequence analysis of 41 wood ducks produced 2 common and 16 rare mtDNA haplotypes with no geographic structure. Hunter-harvested birds had similar haplotypes as breeding birds. For many years, wood duck managers in the southeastern United States have been interested in delineating subpopulations of wood ducks. Our data may reinforce and broaden existing efforts to manage southern wood ducks using management units determined by band returns.},

abstract={Declining numbers of Atlantic Population (AP) Canada geese (Branta canadensis) resulted in the closure of the regular Canada goose hunting season in 1995 in the provinces of Quebec and southeastern Ontario, Canada, and all Atlantic Flyway states except West Virginia and northwestern Pennsylvania. We attached satellite-tracked radiotransmitters to 34 adult females in 1996 and 1997 to refine our understanding of movements to and from the breeding ground in northern Quebec. Geese breeding near the coasts of Hudson Bay and northern Ungava Bay migrated through western Quebec, southeastern Ontario, and central New York to wintering areas in the Chesapeake-Delaware Bay region of the Atlantic Coast. Geese nesting in the southern Ungava Bay region migrated through central Quebec to the Lake Champlain-Hudson River drainage area of eastern New York and the western section of the New England states. Their winter terminus was primarily north of 40° latitude. Both fall and spring migrations were highly synchronized. Geese left the breeding range in late September and were not available for sport harvest in Canada and the United States until October. All birds were on their winter range by mid-to late October. Spring migration began in late February from the Chesapeake-Delaware Bay region, with birds staying in central New York and southeastern Ontario during March and April. A major movement north occurred in early May 1997 and 1998, with birds arriving on their breeding grounds within 1-2 weeks. Limited opportunity, for subsistence harvest was detected during spring and fall migration periods. Our data support the use of experimental hunting seasons in September and late winter to reduce numbers of resident Canada geese while minimizing the incidental harvest of AP geese.},

abstract={Black-billed Magpies (Pica hudsonia) are a relatively sedentary corvid, with greater dispersal of females than males. To genetically confirm that dispersal pattern, 29 reproductively active adults were captured over two years and were scored for primer-specific random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) bands (53 polymorphic bands in 1996 and 104 in 1997). In both years, we captured more previously banded males than females, and individuals recaptured were more often the heaviest nestling in their brood from the previous years. Genetic distances between all possible adult pairs were calculated and degree of genetic similarity between pair-wise comparisons was assessed using the Mantel test. In the pair-wise comparison of genetic distances, data for both years showed that genetic distances between males were significantly less (P < 0.05) than those for other adult combinations (male-female and female-female). Using the same analytical approach, we found that females were no more genetically similar to one another (P > 0.05) than were random pairs of adults. Group-distance analysis using the computer package RAPD also showed higher genetic similarity among males than among females. We suggest that a plausible hypothesis to account for the relatively high genetic homogeneity of the breeding male population compared to the female population is that a long-lasting intraclutch dominance hierarchy exists among siblings. That hierarchy is sufficiently long-lasting to influence the breeding population, resulting in alpha males remaining in the natal area, whereas lower ranking birds, including females, are forced to disperse.},

abstract={Although population genetic structure and geographic differentiation have been reported for many bird species with insular distributions, high vagility typically results in high levels of gene flow and thus little local differentiation among continental populations. This study provides the first survey of population genetic variation in a South American ratite, suggesting that, in an agricultural landscape, recent fragmentation and isolation may affect the genetic structure of flightless bird species. Using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis, I evaluated the population genetic structure of the greater rhea, Rhea americana albescens, by quantifying genetic variability within and among four isolated wild populations located in a highly fragmented region of the Argentinean Pampas. Levels of genetic diversity of the natural populations were compared to those of a captive population used as an inbred "control." An analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) based on a phenotypic analysis of 54 RAPD markers showed that 94.38% of the total observed variance was explained by differences within populations (P < 0.001) whereas 6.37% was due to differences among populations (P = 0.006). In addition, measures of genetic diversity (D: mean genetic diversity, and P: percentage of polymorphic bands) estimated for the wild populations were similar to those of the inbred "control." The pattern of genetic variation reported combined with data on the sizes of eight wild populations and the reproductive success of a focal population are consistent with the idea that relatively recent fragmentation and isolation may have increased local genetic differentiation and decreased within-population levels of genetic variation as a result of genetic drift and inbreeding. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={We tabulate three measures of rarity: local abundance, breeding range size and elevational extent for the passerine birds of the New World. We determine what fraction of species is threatened with extinction within the combinations of these three measures. Species with smaller ranges, lower abundances and narrower elevational bands suffer higher levels of threat across lowland, montane and island species. For a given range size, lowland species suffer higher levels of threat than island or montane species. (This is counter to the intuition that island species - and those isolated on mountain tops - might be ecologically naïve.) When all three factors are considered together, there is only a slight tendency for lowland species to be disproportionately more threatened. Simply, island and montane species tend to be relatively common within their restricted ranges and their increased abundance reduces their likelihood of being threatened. Elevation is a consistent but relatively unimportant factor in determining threat; abundance and range size are much more important, and have an interactive effect on threatened status. We calculate the number of humans with which each species shares its breeding range, and find that this number does not aid in predicting threat status.},

abstract={Scientists often assume that marking animals for research and population management does not affect their behavior, mobility, and survival. Although numerous studies have examined the validity of this assumption on many bird species, few have examined effects of radio transmitters on neonate waterfowl. Our objective was to evaluate exodus rates of marked and unmarked wood duck (Aix sponsa) ducklings from wooden conventional (i.e., large) and experimental (i.e., small) nest boxes. Ducklings were either unmarked or marked with either 1) a back-mounted radiotransmitter and a web tag on one foot (radiomarked); 2) a plasticine-filled aluminum leg band on one leg and a web tag on the other foot (legbanded); or 3) 2 web tags, one on each foot (webtagged). We used 922 unmarked, 125 webtagged, 3,247 legbanded, and 308 radiomarked wood duck ducklings to test hypotheses that exodus rates of differently marked and unmarked ducklings from large and small nest boxes did not differ. We detected neither a box-mark type interaction (P=0.77) nor a separate effect of box and mark type on duckling exodus (P≥ 0.61). Most (98-99%) ducklings successfully exited nest boxes after hatch regardless of type of mark. Our results further support use of radiotransmitters and plasticine-filled legbands in studies of free-ranging wood duck ducklings and young of other waterfowl species.},

abstract={The foraging zones and behaviour of shy albatross Thalassarche cauta were studied at Albatross Island, Tasmania, Australia, during the 1995/96 and 1996/97 breeding seasons, using a combination of archival recorders and satellite telemetry. Birds foraged exclusively in the neritic zone, at a maximum distance of 200 km from the colony, making wide use of continental shelf waters off northwest Tasmania. The duration of foraging trips, the distances traveled and the activity ranges of the birds (i.e. 95% isopleths from Kernel home range analyses) were greatest during incubation (2.8 d, 754 km, 24 667 km2), least during chick-brood (1.1 d, 273 km, 19067 km2), and intermediate during early chick-rearing (1.8 d, 426 km, 19400 km2). At the population level, the foraging zones of the birds (i.e. the 50 % home range isopleths) were highly consistent between years, overlapping by 43% during both the incubation and chick-brooding stages across 3 breeding-seasons. Overall, the foraging zones of males and females were similar in both size and location. Individual birds did not return to the same locations to feed from 1 trip to the next; however, their foraging was not random. On successive trips birds maintained a constant heading from the colony, repeatedly searching the same broad patches of ocean, a degree of site fidelity maintained within a single breeding stage. They flew for 72 % of the daytime and 39% of the night, and their rate of travel was significantly higher during the day. Combined with a diet predominated by prey found at or near the surface during the day, these data suggest that shy albatross are largely diurnal feeders. Nocturnal activity was strongly influenced by moon phase, with increased time spent flying and increased flight speed during full moon. Consistent traveling speeds, foraging trip durations and foraging locations across years suggest relatively stable prey availability and/or accessibility for shy albatross breeding off the northwest coast of Tasmania.},

Compared to males followed in the same fragments (Norris and Stutchbury 2001), females spent significantly less time off territory and traveled shorter distances across nonforested gaps. Unlike males in fragmented habitat and females in continuous forest, we found no evidence that females were actively seeking extrapair copulations. We conclude females are relatively more restricted to isolated fragments during the breeding season and suggest that the lack of extrapair copulation opportunity could contribute to female avoidance of fragmented habitat, resulting in a high number of unmated males. This study emphasizes the importance of examining the potential effects of fragmentation in both sexes.},

abstract={Double-crested Cormorant (Phalacrocorax auritus) predation on Channel Catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) at commercial farms has been estimated to cost the Mississippi aquaculture industry approximately $5 million annually to replace consumed fingerlings. In 1997, catfish producers assumed responsibility for the dispersal of cormorants in night roosts in the eastern (interior) delta region of Mississippi, where catfish farms are concentrated. We documented movements of 50 cormorants marked with radio transmitters in the delta region from January through March 1997. We obtained 161 post-capture day locations and 176 post-capture night roost locations. Cormorants that were harassed at their night roost flew farther to their next day's location than birds that were not harassed the previous night. Of the cormorants for which we had more than one night roost location, only 11% of cormorants that were harassed returned to the same roost within 48 hours, compared with an 81% return of cormorants to a previously un-harassed night roost. Moreover, cormorants in the eastern portion of the delta (where all harassment was conducted) changed night roosts more frequently than cormorants in the western (non-harassed) delta. Since cormorants in our study foraged relatively close to their night roosts and only 11% of the birds that we observed roosting in the western delta traveled to the eastern delta to forage the following day, coordinated and intensive dispersal of cormorants from the interior delta may, temporarily, limit cormorant impacts to Mississippi aquaculture.

abstract={Data from band recoveries and recapture rates are essential for testing influences on key demographic parameters of avian populations. I used recaptures and recoveries of leg-banded birds to test the influence of condition on the probability of survival and to compare site fidelity of American black ducks (Anas rubripes) and mallards (A. platyrhynchos) to the wetlands of southwestern Lake Erie. I live-trapped and banded 996 black ducks and 1,168 mallards from October through January during 3 annual staging periods (1990-1993) on Ottawa National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) in Ohio, USA. Ducks were aged, sexed, and weighed; total body length, wing chord, culmen, and tarsus also were measured to compute condition indices. I used multiple-logistic regression models to test influences of condition, date of initial capture, and species on the probabilities of recapture and band recovery for each age-sex class. Black ducks were more likely to be recaptured than mallards in all age-sex classes within a season and during subsequent seasons. Body condition had a positive influence on recaptures during subsequent field seasons for adults. Analyses of within-season band recovery for adult males of both species indicated that birds with lower condition were more likely to be harvested. The opposite relationships between condition and the probability of recapture and direct recovery support the contention that poor body condition increased vulnerability to hunting for adult males.},

abstract={Forty-seven wild female Lesser Scaup (Aythya affinis) were marked with nasal markers and radio transmitt31ers (implanted subcutaneously on the back) just prior to breeding near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, in 1999 and 2000. Retention rates of both marker types were evaluated, and their effects on specific behavior categories were assessed by comparison of marked birds with unmarked control birds. Significant effects of nasal markers on behavior were detected; females often removed vegetation from nasal markers after diving, and consequently marked females tended to shake their head more frequently than unmarked birds. No nasal markers were lost during the study. Five females lost radios, producing an average retention time of 39 d. Daily retention rate was 0.997, being 0.85 when extrapolated to 60 d. The survival rate of 42 females radio-tracked consistently was constant for six 7-d intervals, suggesting no immediate adverse effect on survival. Because the technique is invasive, use of subcutaneous transmitters may not be appropriate for all applications, but it could be a preferred alternative to other transmitter-attachment methods for short-term tracking of waterfowl.},

abstract={We used several methods to study the chronology and synchrony of breeding events of the Marbled Murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) population at Desolation Sound, British Columbia, from 1996 to 1998. The timing of breeding events varied among years; on average the breeding season lasted from 21 April to 5 September. We assessed the biases of each method used by comparing the results to the estimate of the integrated breeding chronology. Counts of hatch-year birds at sea were biased toward earlier breeders, missing an estimated 24% of the fledglings. Two other methods, physiological analysis of the yolk precursor vitellogenin from blood samples and monitoring by radio-telemetry could produce a complete distribution of breeding events if sampling were done throughout laying. Observations in the forest, date of first observation of a fledgling at sea during the breeding season, and fish-holding behavior produced insufficient data to be used as sole indicators of breeding chronology of this species. In general, breeding synchrony in alcids, assessed using data from a literature review, was unrelated to feeding habits but increased with latitude (41% of the variation was explained by latitude). Marbled Murrelets, however, bred less synchronously than predicted for an alcid at this latitude (50°N).},

abstract={Much research has examined parasitism and predation rates on avian nests within the context of edge effects. Few studies, however, have considered the influence that behavioural compensation for high predation risk may have on subsequent survival rates and edge effects. We attempted to determine whether juvenile red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) experience edge effects by comparing the survival and behaviour of individuals born along a forest edge with those of individuals born in the forest interior. A combination of telemetry, direct observation, and livetrapping was used to determine the fate of juveniles born during the summers of 1987 through 1998 and the behaviour of juveniles born during the summers of 1997 and 1998 in Kluane, Yukon. There were no differences in survival between edge and interior juveniles from birth to emergence but there was a trend towards higher survival rates for edge juveniles from emergence to weaning. Behavioural differences between edge and interior juveniles were consistent with these survival differences: edge juveniles spent less time travelling and foraging and more time resting near the time of weaning than did interior juveniles. Edge and interior mothers differed little behaviourally during the early emergence period. The significant differences in juvenile behaviour which we found suggest that behaviour may indeed moderate differences in predation risk between edge and interior habitats and thus should be considered in other studies that examine the influence of edges on survival or nest predation.},

abstract={We used satellite telemetry to study the migration routes and wintering areas of two allopatric breeding populations of Pacific Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima v-nigrum) in Alaska: the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, and the western Beaufort Sea coast. Only 6% (2 of 36) of females wintered within the wintering area of the other breeding population. Both breeding populations wintered in the closest available ice-free habitat, perhaps to minimize migratory distance. Two Beaufort Sea females wintered in areas used by Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta females, implying potential gene flow among breeding areas. Yet, we conclude that these two populations are largely geographically isolated throughout the annual cycle and the environmental factors influencing survival and reproduction likely differ between these groups of birds. Thus, regardless of the potential gene flow among breeding populations, we suggest that birds from these two breeding areas should be managed as separate populations. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2002.},

We used accelerated failure time models to estimate neckband and legband retention rates and to evaluate sources of variation in neckband and legband loss. We observed considerable neckband and legband loss that varied by sex, year of banding (for neckbands only), and band age. We estimated that 34% of male and 16% of female giant Canada geese had lost their neckbands, and 15% of male and 8% of female giant Canada geese had lost their legbands within 6 years of banding. Neckband-loss rates in our study were lower than those reported for other geese. Conversely, legband-loss rates in our study were higher than those reported for other geese. Neckband and legband loss should be accounted for when estimating population parameters from these types of data.},

Credible harvest management plans for mourning dove populations will require a long-term commitment to population monitoring and iterative population analysis.},

However, results also indicated periodic exploratory movements, with some birds detected up to 30 km from marking sites. Overall, individuals exhibited a low degree of fidelity to specific sites and were detected at an average of 11.9 ± 1.1 sites. No differences were found in monthly movement patterns. In almost all cases, year-round residents were more sedentary than winter residents and winter transients. Results indicate a complex regional population structure and highlight the need to consider both migrant and resident birds, as well as seasonal differences in habitat needs and space use requirements, in future conservation planning efforts.

However, the efficacy and success of these programs need evaluation. We assessed survivorship and behavior of radio-marked western gulls (Larus occidentalis) that were rehabilitated via California's Oiled Wildlife Care Network (OWCN) following the 1997 Torch/Platform Irene Pipeline spill in south-central California. The test groups were 1) oiled and rehabilitated gulls (n=7), 2) non-oiled but rehabilitated gulls (n=10), and 3) non-oiled and not rehabilitated gulls (n=10). All groups were released to the wild in October 1997 and monitored twice weekly by aerial telemetry until January 1998, and once weekly thereafter until June 1998. One non-oiled and not rehabilitated bird died 115 days after release. All oiled and rehabilitated gulls survived until transmitters failed (127-235 days), despite unfavorable El Niño conditions in early 1998. No statistically significant differences could be detected in the size of geographical areas used by the three groups of gulls. The results of this study suggest that modern rehabilitation programs such as OWCN have the potential to reduce impacts to seabird populations from marine oil spills by returning some oiled birds back to wild populations.},

abstract={Using temperature loggers and radio telemetry, foraging and brooding behaviors of female and male Thick-billed Murres (Uria lomvia) were measured during chick rearing at the Gannet Islands, Labrador, to quantify parental roles during this crucial stage of reproduction. We recorded 2,725 foraging dives by 10 females and 7 males during 1,416 bird-hours of monitoring. Our study birds made between 21 and 107 dives per day between 0327 and 2220 hours, with 54% of females' dives and &lt;1% of males' dives occurring in conditions of low illumination between sunset and sunrise. Males foraged mostly at midday and, overall, made longer and presumably deeper dives (mean duration 116.2 ± 37.6 s) than females (mean duration 84.1 ± 46.0 s). The maximum dive duration recorded was 240 s. Final dives of foraging trips were inferred to include dives during which chick meals (∼95% by number daubed shanny [Lumpenus maculatus]) were obtained. Those dives (mean duration 134.0 ± 36.1 s) and dives in final diving bouts prior to return to the breeding site (mean duration 139.1 ± 40.2 s) averaged longer than other dives, and longer in males than in females, but there was no difference between the sexes in their daily frequency. The modal travel time from the last dive in a feeding trip to arrival at the breeding site was 8 min (no difference between sexes), which represents a maximum travel distance at 65 km h-1 of 8.7 km, suggesting that foraging occurred close to the colony. Females spent 9 h day-1 (38% of day, mostly diurnal brooding) at breeding sites whereas males spent 16 h (67% of day, mostly nocturnal brooding). Taken together, these data indicated drastic differences in patterns of foraging and brooding behavior between male and female Thick-billed Murres, but suggest that individual and intercolony variation were also significant.},

abstract={The purpose of this experiment was to determine the effects of Aroclor 1242, a mixture of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), on plumage characteristics and molt in the American kestrel, Falco sparverius. Several characteristics of plumage, including color and molt schedule, are modulated by hormonal signals and hence may be modified by endocrine-active contaminants. If so, the functions of plumage (e.g., communication for mating or territorial defense) may be compromised by exposure to such compounds. Captive American kestrels were fed Aroclor 1242 at 0, 6.0, and 60.0 ppm (n = 6 males and 6 females per treatment) mixed in their normal diet. Concentrations of plasma estradiol and thyroxine were measured weekly from the beginning of treatment. Measured plumage characteristics included width of the black subterminal band on the tail, color (a composite index of hue and saturation), reflectance from 230 to 800 nm, pattern of feather loss and regrowth on the tail and wing, and timing of onset and duration of molt. Aroclor 1242 depressed plasma thyroxine. Plasma estradiol levels remained low due to the phase of the breeding cycle. Treatments did not disrupt the measured plumage characteristics.

abstract={We report band-encounter locations accumulated between 1980 and April 2001 for five species of North American raptors (Sharp-shinned Hawk, Accipiter striatus; Cooper's Hawk, A. cooperii; Northern Goshawk, A. gentilis; Red-tailed Hawk, Buteo jamaicensis; and American Kestrel, Falco sparverius) banded or recaptured during migration in northern Oregon (N= 14), northeastern Nevada (N = 325), and north-central New Mexico (N = 136). Based on a discriminant function analysis of the encounter locations and comparisons of intra- and inter-flyway recapture rates, migrants passing through these areas travel along three distinct regional flyways: Pacific Coast, Intermountain, and Rocky Mountain. Encounter locations of Pacific Coast migrants were generally restricted to west of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade ranges from southern British Columbia through California. Intermountain migrants were encountered from interior Alaska to southwestern Mexico, usually east of the Sierra Nevada-Cascade ranges and west of the Rocky Mountains and Sierra Madre Occidental. Rocky Mountain migrants were found from interior Alaska to southern Mexico, usually within or cast of the latter two ranges. Because encounter distributions tended to converge in the far northwest and southern Mexico, the delineation of regional flyways in western North America is probably most relevant for distinguishing subpopulations of birds that originate south of mainland Alaska and winter north of Central America. During summer and migration seasons, most encounters away from the banding sites resulted from death due to collisions with human structures or unknown causes. In contrast, most winter encounters involved birds shot in Mexico. We also examined the Nevada encounter data for evidence of differential migration distances among age and sex classes, and found a consistent but nonsignificant pattern for four species. Mean winter latitude tended to increase with age within sexes and to be higher for males than females within age classes. These patterns are most consistent with predictions of foraging-efficiency and arrival-time hypotheses proposed to explain differential migration. © 2002 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Generalizations used to support hypotheses about the evolution of fidelity to breeding areas in birds include the tendency for fidelity to be greater in adult birds than in yearlings. In ducks, in contrast to most bird species, fidelity is thought to be greater among females than males. Researchers have suggested that fidelity in ducks is positively correlated with pond availability. However, most estimates of fidelity on which these inferences have been based represent functions of survival and recapture-resighting probabilities in addition to fidelity. We applied the modeling approach developed by Burnham to recapture and band recovery data of mallard ducks to test the above hypotheses about fidelity. We found little evidence of sex differences in adult philopatry, with females being slightly more philopatric than males in one study area, but not in a second study area. However, yearling females were more philopatric than yearling males in both study areas. We found that adults were generally more philopatric than yearlings. We could find no relationship between fidelity and pond availability. Our results, while partially supporting current theory concerning sex and age differences in philopatry, suggest that adult male mallards are more philopatric than once thought, and we recommend that other generalizations about philopatry be revisited with proper estimation techniques.},

abstract={We studied the dispersal behavior of 1,475 northern spotted owls (Strix occidentalis caurina) during banding and radio-telemetry studies in Oregon and Washington in 1985-1996. The sample included 324 radio-marked juveniles and 1,151 banded individuals (711 juveniles, 440 non-juveniles) that were recaptured or resighted after dispersing from the initial banding location. Juveniles typically left the nest during the last week in May and the first two weeks in June (x̄ ± SE = 8 June ± 0.53 days, n = 320, range = 15 May-1 July), and spent an average of 103.7 days in the natal territory after leaving the nest (SE = 0.986 days, n = 137, range = 76-147 days). The estimated mean date that juveniles began to disperse was 19 September in Oregon (95% CI = 17-21 September) and 30 September in Washington (95% CI = 25 September-4 October). Mean dispersal dates did not differ between males and females or among years. Siblings dispersed independently. Dispersal was typically initiated with a series of rapid movements away from the natal site during the first few days or weeks of dispersal. Thereafter, most juveniles settled into temporary home ranges in late October or November and remained there for several months. In February-April there was a second pulse of dispersal activity, with many owls moving considerable distances before settling again in their second summer. Subsequent dispersal patterns were highly variable, with some individuals settling permanently in their second summer and others occupying a series of temporary home ranges before eventually settling on territories when they were 2-5 years old. Final dispersal distances ranged from 0.6-111.2 km for banded juveniles and 1.8-103.5 km for radio-marked juveniles. The distribution of dispersal distances was strongly skewed towards shorter distances, with only 8.7% of individuals dispersing more than 50 km. Median natal dispersal distances were 14.6 km for banded males, 13.5 km for radio-marked males, 24.5 km for banded females, and 22.9 km for radio-marked females. On average, banded males and females settled within 4.2 and 7.0 territory widths of their natal sites, respectively. Maximum and final dispersal distances were largely independent of the number of days that juveniles were tracked. Although statistical tests of dispersal direction based on all owls indicated that direction of natal dispersal was non-random, the mean angular deviations and 95% CI's associated with the samples were large, and r-values (vector length) were small. This lead us to conclude that significant test results were the result of large sample size and were not biologically meaningful. Our samples were not large enough to test whether dispersal direction from individual territories was random. In the sample of radio-marked owls, 22% of males and 44% of females were paired at 1 year of age, but only 1.5% of males and 1.6% of females were actually breeding at 1 year of age. At 2 years of age, 68% of males and 77% of females were paired, but only 5.4% of males and 2.6% of females were breeding. In contrast to the radio-marked owls, most juveniles that were banded and relocated at 1 or 2 years of age were paired, although few were breeding. Although recruitment into the territorial population typically occurred when owls were 1-5 years old, 9% of banded juveniles were not recaptured until they were > 5 years old. We suspect that our estimates of age at recruitment of banded owls are biased high because of the likelihood that some individuals were not recaptured in the first year that they entered the territorial population. A minimum of 6% of the banded, non-juvenile owls on our demographic study areas changed territories each year (breeding dispersal). The likelihood of breeding dispersal was higher for females, young owls, owls that did not have a mate in the previous year, and owls that lost their mate from the previous year through death or divorce. Mean and median distances dispersed by adults were shorter than for juveniles, and did not differ between the sexes or study areas (x̄ = 6.1 km, median = 3.5 km). Owls that were 1-2 years old tended to disperse farther than owls that were > 2 years old. The direction of post-natal dispersal did not differ from random. The large nonforested valleys of western Oregon (Willamette, Umpqua, Rogue Valleys) acted as barriers to dispersal between the Coast Ranges and the Cascade Mountains. However, dispersal did occur between the Coast Ranges and Cascade Mountains in the forested foothills between the non-forested valleys. Forest landscapes traversed by dispersing owls typically included a fragmented mosaic of roads, clear-cuts, non-forest areas, and a variety of forest age classes ranging from young forests on cutover areas, to old-growth forests ≥ 250 years old. Our data fit the general pattern observed in birds in that females dispersed farther than males and dispersal distances were negatively skewed towards short distance dispersers. Comparison of data from radio-marked and banded owls demonstrated that the negatively skewed distribution of dispersal distances represented the actual distribution of dispersal distances, and was not the result of small study area bias on recaptures. We found no correlation between dispersal distance and age at first breeding, which suggests that reproductive fitness is not affected by dispersal distance. We observed only 3 cases of close inbreeding (parent-offspring or sibling pairs) in thousands of pairs of spotted owls, suggesting that dispersal results in a very low incidence of close inbreeding in the spotted owl. However, inbreeding with more distant relatives was common.},

abstract={Research to evaluate rodenticides often requires determining bait efficacy, retrieving carcasses of poisoned rodents for chemical analyses, and quantifying nontarget and secondary hazards and mortalities. Traditional methods of retrieving carcasses from burrows (telemetry and excavation) are expensive and inefficient. Further, they do not address non-target issues. Researchers need more innovative and effective methods to locate and retrieve poisoned fossorial rodents. Information on the distance at which rodents die from the entrance of their burrows is also needed to assess secondary hazards to scavengers. We evaluated a burrow-probe camera and hook system for viewing inside burrows and retrieving carcasses of poisoned California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi). We probed 654 burrows and found 31 rodent carcasses within 2 m of the burrow entrance, 23 of which we retrieved. We found carcasses at a mean depth of 1 m (SE=0.07, n=31), too deep to be available to most surface avian or mammalian scavengers. Average time to probe 50 active burrows in 1- to 4-ha plots was 2 hr 24 min (SE=17, n=11). The system was also useful for collecting descriptive information on live squirrels and nontarget species.},

During the autumn and winter of 1998, the migration of six adult loons that were radio marked in northern Wisconsin and Minnesota was monitored. The results of this work offer insight into autumn movement patterns of Common Loons. Timing of autumn staging and migration to wintering grounds appeared to be related to low pressure systems that delivered winter weather to the Upper Midwest. Most of the radiomarked birds staged on the Great Lakes and then followed one of two distinct migration routes to the Gulf of Mexico and Atlantic coasts. Several of the birds used lakes and reservoirs in the southeastern United States during migration. This study provides a basis for more extensive studies of Common Loon migration.},

abstract={Long-distance seed dispersai influences many critical ecological processes by improving chances of gene flow and maintaining genetic diversity among plant populations. Accordingly, large-scale movements by frugivores may have important conservation implications as they provide an opportunity for long-distance seed dispersal. We studied movement patterns, resource tracking, and potential long-distance seed dispersal by two species of Ceratogymna hornbills, the black-casqued hornbill C. atrata, and the white-thighed hornbill C. cylindricus, in lowland tropical forests of Cameroon. We determined fruiting phenology of 24 tree species important in hornbill diet at monthly intervals and compared these patterns to monthly hornbill census data. After capture and radio-tagging of 16 hornbills, we used radio telemetry by vehicle and fixed wing aircraft to determine the extent of long-distance movements. Hornbills exhibited up to 20-fold changes in numbers in response to fruit availability in our 25 km2 study area. Also, hornbills made large-scale movements up to 290 km, which are larger than any movement previously reported for large avian frugivores. Together, these observations provide direct evidence that hornbills are not resident and that hornbills track available fruit resources. Our results suggest that Ceratogymna hornbills embark on long-distance movements, potentially dispersing seeds and contributing to rain forest regeneration and diversity.},

abstract={Integrated waterbird management over the past few decades has implicitly referred to methods for managing wetlands that usually attempt to enhance habitat for taxonomic groups such as shorebirds and wading birds, in addition to waterfowl, the traditional focus group. Here I describe five elements of integration in management: taxonomic, spatial, temporal, population and habitat, and multiple-use management objectives. Spatial integration simply expands the scale of management concern. Rather than emphasizing management on a very limited number of impoundments or wetlands in small refuges or wildlife management areas, the vision is beginning to shift to connectivity within larger landscapes on the order of many square kilometers as telemetry data on daily and seasonal movements for many species become available. Temporal integration refers to the potential for either simultaneous management for waterbirds and commercial "crops" (e.g., crayfish and rice) or for temporally-staggered management such as row crop production in spring-summer growing seasons and waterbird management on fallow fields in the non-growing (winter) season. Integrating population dynamics with habitats has become a major research focus over the past decade. Identifying which wetlands are "sources" or "sinks" for specific populations provides managers with critical information about effective management. Further, the applications of spatially explicit population models place heavy demands on researchers to identify use patterns for breeding and dispersing individuals by age, sex, and reproductive class. Population viability analysis models require much the same information. Finally, multiple-use management integration refers to trying to optimize the uses of wetlands, when only one (perhaps secondary) use may include waterbird management. Depending upon the ownership and primary land use of a particular parcel of land containing wetlands and/or water bodies, managing for waterbirds may be an "easy sell" (e.g., public natural resource lands) or a very contentious one, where wetlands are created for industrial, aquaculture or urban uses. In the latter case, careful planning and implementation require broad stakeholder participation and education.},

abstract={The San Francisco Bay estuary is a migration and wintering area for more than 1.5 million waterbirds on the west coast of North America. Because the estuary is located in a metropolitan area, development and diking of baylands (the region between the edge of the bay and the historical high tide line) have greatly altered the wetland landscape. Recently, conservation interests have promoted restoration of diked baylands to tidal salt marshes for the benefit of endangered native species. However, effects of tidal marsh conversion on the existing community of waterbirds in the baylands are largely unknown, especially in muted tidal marshes with restricted inflows and in artificial salt evaporation ponds where high waterbird densities are found. The first radio-marking study of the Long-billed Dowitcher (Limnodromus scolopaceus) was conducted in November-December 2000 to examine their use of baylands. We captured 32 birds by rocket netting in a muted tidal marsh on the North Bay and radio-marked them with 1.2 g transmitters affixed with glue. Individuals were tracked for an average of 20.3 d (±8.5 SD) and obtained 217 high tide and 195 low tide locations. Movements between tides (x̄ = 1.29 ± 1.48 SD km) and home range sizes (x̄ = 17.7 ± 16.0 SD km2) were highly variable. Long-billed Dowitchers preferred open habitats such as muted tidal marshes during the high tide, but the majority (78.5%) also remained in these wetlands during low tide rather than feeding at nearby mud flats. Their avoidance of mud flats contrasted sharply with Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri) but was similar to Black-necked Stilts (Himantopus mexicanus). Seven Long-billed Dowitchers flew 110 km inland to Central Valley wetlands in mid-December, a regional movement documented earlier for Dunlin (Calidris alpina) wintering on the coast. However, unlike Dunlin, their movements were not in response to rainfall but may have been in response to a low pressure front or possibly predictable flooding of fields in the Central Valley. Although the estuary is a major wintering area supporting large numbers of waterbirds, some birds such as Long-billed Dowitchers move inland to freshwater wetlands in the Central Valley.},

abstract={Avian field studies commonly employ colored leg bands to follow individual birds without recapturing them. However, this technique is subject to several types of reporting errors. In a laboratory setting under ideal Conditions, we marked model birds with colored band combinations to examine resighting rates and errors made by trained and untrained observers. We varied both the time of exposure and the number of birds presented to observers in a series of replicate trials. We found large variation in the number of incorrectly recorded combinations among both trained and untrained observers. The mean error rate for trained observers was 5%, and for untrained observers was 16%. In both groups, error rates significantly increased when observers were exposed to more birds or observation intervals were short. The most common type of error involved switching band combinations on left and right legs. In some cases incorrectly recorded combinations matched actual combinations used on other birds. We also found that resighting probabilities depended on the particular colors used. Because this study was performed under indoor lighting conditions and at a relatively close distance (to mimic conditions under which birds are viewed at nearby feeders), we suggest that the error rates we observed likely represent low estimates and that error rates under field conditions will be higher.},

We implanted either a 26-g VHF radio transmitter or a larger VHF radio that was the same mass (35 g) and shape as a satellite transmitter in the coelom of adult females captured during molt in 2000. A control group of females was marked with leg bands. We simultaneously observed behavior of radio-marked and control females from 4-62 d following capture. We observed no differences in the proportion of time birds in different treatments allocated among grazing, resting, comfort, walking, and alert behavior. Females in different treatments spent a similar proportion of time in the water. Implantation of radio transmitters did not affect the frequency of agonistic interactions. We conclude that coelomic radio transmitters with percutaneous antennas had minimal effects on the behavior of Canada Geese.},

abstract={We report first-year survival rates of 49 captive-reared Hispaniolan Parrots (Amazona ventralis) released in Parque Nacional del Este, Dominican Republic. Our goal was to learn about factors affecting postrelease survival. Specifically, we tested if survival was related to movements and whether modifying prerelease protocols influenced survival rates. We also estimated survival in the aftermath of Hurricane Georges (22 September 1998). Twenty-four parrots, fitted with radio-transmitters, were released between 14 September and 12 December 1997. Twenty-five more were released between 29 June and 16 September 1998. First-year survival rates were 30% in 1997 and 29% in 1998. Survival probability was related to bird mobility. In contrast to birds released in 1997, none of the 25 parrots released in 1998 suffered early postrelease mortality (i.e., 3-5 days after release). Two adjustments to prerelease protocols (increased exercise and reduced blood sampling) made in 1998 may have contributed to differences in mobility and survival between years. The reduction of early postrelease mortality in 1998 was encouraging, as was the prospect for higher first-year survival (e.g., 30% to 65%). Only one death was attributed to the immediate impact of the hurricane. Loss of foraging resources was likely a major contributor to ensuing mortality. Birds increased their mobility, presumably in search of food. Survival rates dropped 23% in only eight weeks posthurricane. This study underscores the value of standardized prerelease protocols, and of estimating survival and testing for factors that might influence it. Inferences from such tests will provide the best basis to make adjustments to a release program.},

The Atlantic Population, based on previous studies of seasonal movements and demography, appeared to be reproductively isolated from the North Atlantic Population. We found that these two populations were genetically differentiated based on microsatellite allele and mtDNA haplotype frequencies. Findings of high levels of genetic discordance among North American breeding populations are consistent with migratory movements, despite high levels of distributional overlap of birds from the North Atlantic and Atlantic Populations during migration and on wintering areas. Findings based on genetic markers were concordant with satellite telemetry conducted during spring migration, which showed that birds destined for Greenland migrate through the southern Ungava Bay breeding colony. Genetic differences among these populations are useful for addressing other issues of ecological or management concern.},

abstract={Ruby Lake, Nevada, is a large palustrine wetland that hosts the southern-most major breeding population of Canvasbacks (Aythya valisineria). That arid marsh, fed by springs derived from mountain snowpack, differs in climate and hydrology from glaciated potholes of the northern prairies where most Canvasbacks breed. Fourteen years of nesting data on Canvasbacks over a 31 year period (1970-2000) were analyzed to determine factors affecting breeding performance at Ruby Lake and whether they differed from those in the prairies. Long-term Mayfield nest success at Ruby Lake (50% of all nests) was in the range of that in the northern prairies (21-65%). Of all Canvasback nests, 73% were parasitized (mostly by Redheads [Aythya americana]) as compared to 83-97% in a large Manitoba marsh and 57-65% in Manitoba potholes. However, as in the northern prairies, nest parasitism generally had little or no effect on either nest success or percentage of host eggs that hatched. In Manitoba potholes, nest success was unrelated to habitat variables measured; but successful nests at Ruby Lake were over shallower water, farther from shore, in wider bands of emergent vegetation, and surrounded by lower stem densities than unsuccessful nests. Water level is the key factor in breeding performance of Canvasbacks at both Ruby Lake and the northern prairies; however, the source of water differs (mountain snowpack at Ruby Lake, direct precipitation in the prairies) and effects of water-level variations are reversed. In small prairie potholes (mostly &lt;0.4 ha) with many mammalian predators, productivity of Canvasbacks (which build floating nests) is increased by high water that floods the emergent fringe. At Ruby Lake, a very large marsh (2,830 ha) with mostly avian predators, Canvasback productivity is decreased by high water that floods interior emergent stands too deeply. Water level at Ruby Lake was highly correlated (multiple R2 = 0.91) with mountain snowpack up to three years earlier, emphasizing the strong effect of climatic variations on wetland birds in that arid region.},

abstract={Current estimates of annual survival, an important process affecting population dynamics, are lacking for breeding-waterfowl populations in Washington. I used hunting-season recoveries in conjunction with band-recovery models (program MARK) to estimate survival and recovery probabilities of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and Gadwalls (A. strepera) banded in eastern Washington during 1981-1998. I also evaluated hypotheses about sources of variation in these rates and described the geographical and temporal distribution of band recoveries. Mallard survival and recovery probabilities were sex and age-specific, and recovery rates were year-specific but not strongly correlated with harvest regulations. Survival probability of Mallards was 0.661 for adult males, 0.660 for immature females, 0.606 for adult females, and 0.560 for immature males. Average recovery rates were generally highest for immature males (0.083) followed by adult males (0.050), immature females (0.050), and adult females (0.029). Survival and recovery rates of Gadwalls were 0.576 and 0.054, respectively, but sample size was small (52 recoveries from 436 banded birds) and sex-age classes were pooled prior to analysis. Seventy-two percent of Mallards banded in eastern Washington were recovered in the Columbia Basin of central Washington. The proportion of adult-male recoveries decreased in the Columbia Basin (from 75% in 1981-84 to 54% in 1995-98) and increased in California (from 4% to 22%). The distribution of direct recoveries of Gadwalls was similar to Mallards. My data suggest that annual survival of Mallards and Gadwalls banded in eastern Washington was similar to or slightly higher than survival probabilities in other North America populations.},

abstract={Direct recoveries for Canada goose (Branta canadensis interior) goslings from the portion of the Southern James Bay Population (SJBP) on Akimiski Island, Nunavut, Canada, have declined markedly since 1987. We suspected that poor gosling nutrition, due to limited food resources on brood-rearing areas, was causing low survival. Consequently, we measured body size and condition of 2,893 unfledged goslings during late July and early August, 1994-1996. Based on 128 recoveries of dead birds during hunting seasons and 69 recaptures during summer on Akimiski Island, we estimated the separate influences of gosling size and condition on subsequent probabilities of recovery by hunters and survival. Estimated survival probabilities were 0.025, 0.051, and 0.147, and reporting probabilities were 0.0026, 0.0051, and 0.0142 for 1994-1996, respectively. Annual variation in both probabilities was related to size and condition of goslings, which were largest and in the best condition in 1996, followed by 1995, and then 1994. Estimates of slopes suggested that relatively small increases in both body size and condition resulted in increased survival and reporting probabilities. Unlike previous waterfowl research, our results showed that the largest goslings, and those in the best condition, were the most likely to be shot. We suggest that goslings in poor condition died on Akimiski Island before they fledged. We conclude that food availability was limiting recruitment, and predict that harvest restrictions on SJBP Canada geese will not result in an increase in the segment of the population that nests on Akimiski Island.},

abstract={Bare-necked Umbrellabird Cephalopterus glabricollis is endemic to Costa Rica and western Panama. It eats fruit, breeding at high elevations (≥ 800 m) and migrating to lower elevations during the non-breeding season. Using data from transect counts and radio-telemetry, we monitored bird movements in a protected area (Monteverde-Arenal-San Ramón reserves) in the Tilarán Mountains, Costa Rica. We also monitored fruit abundance along an altitudinal gradient to explore the potential relationship between bird movements and the abundance of the fruits this species consumed. The presence and abundance of umbrellabirds at high elevations (1,400 m) during the breeding season (March-June) coincided with the highest peak of fruit abundance. The presence of umbrellabirds in the lowlands (400 m) during the non-breeding season overlapped with the period of highest fruit abundance at these elevations. At middle elevations, bird presence and abundance did not correlate with fruit abundance. Radio-tagged birds left the protected area during the non-breeding season and there were no umbrellabirds inside the protected area during this period. Habitats where this species bred were well represented in the protected area but the habitat where they spent the non-breeding season was poorly represented, and was not adequately protected. This represents a potential threat to this species in the Tilarán Mountains.},

abstract={Mostly indirect evidence has shown that the size of bird colonies is often related positively to the size of foraging areas, in turn an indirect measure of prey availability. We report here results of an unusual opportunity to directly investigate the relationships among the size and distribution of colonies of Black-legged Kittiwakes (Rissa tridactyla), the degree of overlap of colony-specific foraging areas, and the availability of kittiwake prey, principally Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) and sand lance (Ammodytes hexapterus), in Prince William Sound, Alaska, 1995-1999. Aerial surveys to assess prevalence of prey schools visible at the surface (the kittiwake mode of prey search) allowed quantification of prey availability in foraging areas. Foraging areas and foraging ranges were determined by radio telemetry. Large colonies occurred as far apart as physically possible and not within foraging range (∼40 km) of one another; only small colonies occurred within the respective ranges of large colonies. Foraging range, foraging trip duration, and area of foraging grounds were related positively to colony size. Down to the finest scale (1.5 nautical miles, or 2.8 km), the presence-absence of foraging kittiwakes was related to where prey schools were likely to occur, rather than there being a direct relationship between densities of kittiwakes and observed prey schools. Annual variation in school density did not alter the relationship between colony size and size of foraging grounds, i.e., more abundant prey did not reduce the size of the foraging ground. Importantly, the quality of foraging grounds (prevalence of fish schools at the surface) decreased with colony size. We conclude that the density of foraging kittiwakes within Prince William Sound has reached a limit: additional birds would compromise access to prey, probably by passive foraging interference. This pattern would explain why overall numbers of breeding kittiwakes in the Sound have remained relatively stable during the past few decades, whereas several colonies have dramatically increased in size and others have decreased or disappeared.},

abstract={The study of patterns and underlying mechanisms within hybrid zones may provide insight into speciation. Black-capped (Poecile atricapillus; BC) and Carolina (P. carolinensis; CA) chickadees hybridize in an east-west band in the U.S.A. from New Jersey to Kansas. Within the past century, the Ohio portion of this hybrid zone and the CA range to the south have been moving northward while the BC range has retracted. We examined mate preference in females of both species as one possible causal mechanism for this shift. To be conservative about the nomenclature and results, the samples are referred to as either 'BC-like' or 'CA-like' due to the observed genetic introgression in the study individuals. Given a choice within an aviary setting, in the aggregate, BC-like and CA-like females that had not observed the direct social interactions between a dyad of a BC-like male and a CA-like male preferred to associate with the BC-like male. In nature, both species form within-sex dominance hierarchies. In the aviary, CA-like males dominated BC-like males unless a CA-like male was substantially smaller. Once females of both types had observed the physical interaction of a particular heterospecific dyad, they associated preferentially with the dominant male, regardless of species type. Thus, the effect of CA male intrasexual dominance on female mate preference may be contributing to the northward movement of the hybrid zone. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd on behalf of The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={We used satellite platform transmitting transmitters (PTTs) in 1998-2000 to track spring and fall migratory movements of Tundra Swans (Cygnus columbianus columbianus) captured at Long Point, Ontario. Migration corridors reported here corroborated those identified in previous studies using alphanumerically coded neck collars. However, PTTs provided additional information on duration of spring and fall migrations, duration of stay in different staging regions, time spent on breeding and wintering areas, and migration speed. Birds migrated between the Atlantic coast and northern prairies along a narrow geographic corridor through portions of the southern Great Lakes. From the northern prairies, swans followed 3 corridors to breeding areas on the west coast of Hudson Bay, central High Arctic, and Mackenzie River delta. While swans spent considerable time on Great Lakes (27% of spring migration) and northern prairie (40%) staging areas in spring, the northern boreal forest was an important fall staging area (48% of fall migration). Tundra Swans spent 20% of the annual cycle on wintering areas, 28% on spring staging areas, 29% on breeding areas, and 23% on fall staging areas. The long duration of migration and the fact that birds spend half their lives on staging areas underscore the importance of conserving Tundra Swan migratory habitats. Thirty-gram neck-collar-attached PTTs were more suitable than 95-g Teflon-harness-attached backpack PTTs for tracking Tundra Swans.},

abstract={Albatross movements and foraging grounds during the post-breeding dispersal are poorly understood, despite their important conservation implications. We tracked four female black-footed albatrosses (Phoebastria nigripes) for 100 days during their summer (July-September, 1997-1999) post-breeding dispersal off California, and compared their movements to the distribution of fishing effort from the Japanese Eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO) longline fishery. The tracked birds foraged largely along the transition zone between the California Current and the Central Pacific Gyre, and spent 25, 24, and 51% of their time at sea within the 200-mile exclusive economic zones (EEZs) of the USA and Mexico, and the high seas (international waters) respectively. The satellite-tracked birds occupied subtropical waters (18-20°C) targeted by longline fisheries for tuna (Thunnus spp.) and broad-bill swordfish (Xiphias gladius), and ranged disproportionately farther during daylight hours, when tuna fisheries operate. The available data suggest that albatrosses overlap temporally and spatially with longline fisheries in the northeast Pacific Ocean. However, this research cannot directly evaluate whether black-footed albatross bycatch occurs in these fisheries. The coarse temporal (monthly) and spatial (1°×1°) resolution of the fisheries data, and the dynamic nature of the fishing effort inhibited a fine-scale analysis of albatross overlap with longline fisheries. While we documented substantial spatial overlap between albatross distributions and the Japanese EPO longline fishing effort during the 1980s, we found no co-occurrence during the 1990s. This study illustrates the value of satellite telemetry to assess national conservation responsibilities, and to identify potential interactions of protected species with fisheries not currently monitored by observer programs. Furthermore, our results underscore the need to exercise caution when interpreting satellite telemetry data for conservation purposes, because of the highly dynamic nature of pelagic fisheries. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract={Many of today's agricultural landscapes once held vast amounts of wetland habitat for waterbirds and other wildlife. Successful restoration of these landscapes relies on access to accurate maps of the wetlands that remain. We used C-band (5.6-cm-wavelength), HH-polarized radar remote sensing (RADARSAT) at a 38° incidence angle (8-m resolution) to map the distribution of winter shorebird (Charadriiformes) habitat on agricultural lands in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon. We acquired imagery on three dates (10 December 1999, 27 January 2000, and 15 March 2000) and simultaneously collected ground reference data to classify radar signatures and evaluate map accuracy of four habitat classes: (1) wet with ≤ 50% vegetation (considered optimal shorebird habitat), (2) wet with > 50% vegetation, (3) dry with ≤ 50% vegetation, and (4) dry with > 50% vegetation. Overall accuracy varied from 45 to 60% among the three images, but the accuracy of focal class 1 was greater, ranging from 72 to 80%. Class 4 coverage was stable and dominated maps (40% of mapped study area) for all three dates, while class 3 coverage decreased slightly throughout the study period. Among wet classes, class 1 was most abundant (30% coverage) in December and January, decreasing in March by 15%. Conversely, class 2 increased dramatically from January to March, likely due to transition from class 1 as vegetation grew. This approach was successful in detecting optimal habitat for shorebirds on agricultural lands. For modest classification schemes, radar remote sensing is a valuable option for wetland mapping in areas where cloud cover is persistent. © 2003 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract={There is growing evidence that harnesses may not be an effective technique to attach radio-transmitters on geese. The use of neck collars is an alternative, but studies on the effect of collars with or without radios on geese have reached divergent conclusions. As our objective was to determine if radio neck collars affect behaviour, pair bonds and breeding success of greater snow geese Anser caerulescens atlanticus, we fitted 230 females with radio neck collars during the 1995-1998 moulting periods on Bylot Island, Nunavut. Data were subsequently obtained for 159 birds on the staging and breeding grounds. Radios represented 2.5 ± 0.1% (± SE) of the birds' body mass. Unmarked geese and those fitted with conventional plastic collars served as controls. The behaviour of radio-collared geese was affected during the first fall after marking, but negative effects disappeared thereafter. Geese with conventional collars had similar behaviour as unmarked birds. Divorce rates were low for birds with conventional collars (0-4%), but were as great as 30% for radio-collared geese. We suggest that the modified behaviour of the radio-collared females promoted separation from the male. Apparent breeding propensity, nest initiation date, clutch size and nesting success of radio-marked birds were also negatively affected. Until better alternatives are developed, we recommend minimizing the mass of radio collars to < 2.5% of the birds' body mass and reducing the antenna length. This implies a trade-off between effects on birds and performance of the transmitters in terms of battery mass (longevity) and antenna length (range).},

Eighty-eight percent of the neck-banded geese were from the western portion of the midcontinent population of greater white-fronted geese, primarily representing Interior-Northwest Alaska, Yukon, and Anderson River breeding populations. These breeding populations are characterized by declining trends in population size and survival rates.

abstract={The ability to rapidly and reliably determine the sex of birds is very important for successful captive-bird breeding programs, as well as for field research. Visual inspection of adult birds is sufficient for sexually dimorphic species, but nestlings and monomorphic species are difficult, if not impossible, to sex by sight only. A method for rapid extraction of gDNA from blood, shell-membrane blood vessels, and fully grown feathers, using Chelex, and the PCR conditions for determination of sex-specific bands in 47 species (39 genera, 21 families, and 10 orders) are described. The PCR primers used amplify a length of DNA spanning an intron in the CHD-1 gene, which is present on both the W and Z chromosomes. The intron differs in size between the two sex chromosomes, resulting in PCR products that separate into two bands for females and a single band for males in most avian species (except ratites). Because this simple technique uses Chelex, a rapid gDNA isolation protocol, and sets of PCR primers independent of restriction enzyme digestion, birds can be accurately sexed within 5 hr of sample collection. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract={Breeding populations of Long-tailed Ducks Clangula hyemalis have declined in western Alaska, particularly on the Yukon-Kuskokwim (Y-K) Delta, and the species is currently considered a species of particular concern by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service in Alaska. Potential factors that may have contributed to this decline that occurred away from the breeding grounds could not be considered since moulting and wintering areas for this population were unknown. A study was conducted in 1998 and 1999 to locate the moulting and wintering areas of the Y-K Delta breeding population. VHF and satellite transmitters were deployed to identify areas used by moulting birds. Based on the locations identified by satellite telemetry, aerial surveys were flown to locate birds marked with VHF transmitters, then low-level aerial surveys were designed and conducted to determine the number of birds using these and adjacent areas. Moulting locations of 54 marked female Long-tailed Ducks were identified: 13 marked females were found in wetlands and large lakes on the Y-K Delta, 11 in coastal lagoons at St Lawrence Island, Alaska, and two along the coast of the Chukotka Peninsula, Russia. A autumn staging area was identified along the east coast of the Chukotka Peninsula which was used by seven of 10 birds with satellite transmitters providing locations during that period. Birds wintered in coastal waters of the North Pacific Ocean north of 50°N and between 150°E and 130°W. The wide distribution of birds in winter suggests little probability of a single factor in winter contributing to the decline.},

abstract={Intraspecific migration patterns in birds have both spatial and temporal components. Two commonly reported spatial patterns are leap-frog and chain migration. Temporal migration patterns refer to the timing of migration of populations from different breeding latitudes. We investigated the spatial and temporal migration patterns of hatching-year (HY) sharp-shinned hawks Accipiter striatus of interior North America using stable-hydrogen isotope and band encounter analyses. Feather samples were collected from hawks migrating through New Mexico, USA and measured for their stable-hydrogen isotope ratios (δD) to distinguish individuals originating from relatively high and low natal latitudes. We then examined the relationship between feather δD values and passage dates through New Mexico, USA. We also gathered band encounter data from the Bird Banding Lab of the United States Geological Survey to determine the wintering latitudes of HY sharp-shinned hawks relative to their passage date through migration banding sites in interior North America. Combining these data, we found that during fall migration HY sharp-shinned hawks used a chain migration pattern, that is, hawks originating from lower latitudes wintered further south than those from higher latitudes. In addition, birds originating from lower latitudes passed through interior North America earlier than those from higher latitudes. We also found that hawks from higher latitudes were significantly larger than those from lower latitudes, and that females from higher latitudes had significantly higher estimated fat levels than females from lower latitudes.},

We review statistical methodology available to estimate movement probabilities. We begin with cases where individual birds can be marked and their movements estimated with the use of multisite capture-recapture methods. Movements can be monitored either directly, using telemetry, or by accounting for detection probability when conventional marks are used. When one or more sites are unobservable, telemetry, band recoveries, incidental observations, a closed- or open-population robust design, or partial determinism in movements can be used to estimate movement. When individuals cannot be marked, presence-absence data can be used to model changes in occupancy over time, providing indirect inferences about movement. Where abundance estimates over time are available for multiple sites, potential coupling of their dynamics can be investigated using linear cross-correlation or nonlinear dynamic tools.},

abstract={Having become suspicious of telemetry-based survival rates reported for northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), we surveyed the published record to determine whether reported survival rates were consistent with empirical expectations of production, for which there exists a vast database. If the production (juvenile/adult) required to stabilize a population at a reported or inferred annual survival rate was ≤7, we deemed the reported survival rate reasonable; otherwise, we deemed it not reasonable. We obtained 58 estimates of survival rates for unique points in space and time; 83% of these were not reasonable (apparently biased low). These results and supporting information strongly suggest (but do not necessarily prove) that radio packages (harness, transmitter, antenna) somehow handicap bobwhites. We recommend that researchers be extremely skeptical of telemetry data, plan telemetry studies such that independent data on population performance are available for comparison with telemetry estimates, and discuss the demographic implications of telemetry estimates. We also suggest that radiotelemetry might not always be appropriate for a given research question and that alternative methods be employed whenever possible.},

Black Vultures concentrated their movements around the primary roost, whereas Turkey Vultures demonstrated less site fidelity. Home-range sizes and time spent soaring for both species were much greater than reported for vultures residing in an agricultural landscape.

A total of 193 day locations and 396 night roost locations of the cormorants were obtained, Each cormorant was found in the study area for 57 ± 4 (SE) days. Each cormorant averaged three night roosts (range: 1-8) and spent 20 (±2) days at each night roost site. Over 95% of cormorant day locations were within 19 km of their night roosts. Catfish pond use by cormorants varied between roost sites. Cormorants from five of eleven night roosts had ≥30% of subsequent daytime locations on catfish ponds and birds from five of the six remaining night roosts did not visit catfish ponds on the following day, Foraging distance and frequency of night roost interchange was less for birds in this study than those reported from other aquaculture regions. We Suggest roost harassment efforts should be focused on specific roost sites and some roost sites should serve as unharrassed refugia from which cormorants are less likely to cause damage to aquaculture.},

abstract={Cottonwood (Populus deltoides) woodlands are important habitats for birds. Yet, little is known of the relations between bird habitat and succession in these woodlands. We studied the bird community in cottonwood woodlands from early to late seral stages along the Missouri River in central South Dakota from 1990 to 1992 to describe quantitative relations between avifauna and ecological patterns of succession in cottonwood woodlands along the Missouri River. The vegetation in the early seral cottonwood was characterized by a high density of seedlings and saplings that were restricted to narrow bands along the rivers. Late seral cottonwoods were characterized by a few large old trees that extended across the flood plain. Seventy-nine percent of the bird species were woodland obligates. Birds that nest in trees or cavities were the most common, while shrub and ground nesting birds were relatively uncommon. Total bird abundance, species diversity, species richness, richness of woodland obligates, abundance in the tree-nesting guild, abundance in the cavity-nesting guild and abundance in the shrub-nesting guild were greater (P < 0.01) in late and late intermediate seral cottonwood stands. Patterns of bird use in cottonwood seral stages by individual species were less evident. Several species were more abundant (P < 0.08) in late or late intermediate seral cottonwood and no species were more abundant (P > 0.10) in early or early intermediate seral cottonwood. Bell's vireos (Vireo belli), indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and brown thrashers (Toxostoma rufum) occurred predominantly in early or early intermediate seral stages, but no significant differences among seral stages were noted. Expanses of late seral cottonwood on flood plains will likely decline because controlled river flows reduce flooding that is necessary for cottonwood regeneration. Cottonwood regeneration was evident only in narrow bands along the river channels. Cavity nesting species will be the most negatively affected by loss of late seral cottonwood.},

abstract={We investigated the yearlong territorial behavior of White-bellied Antbirds (Myrmeciza longipes) in Panama by conducting 17 experimental removals during the nonbreeding season on both sexes. We also monitored the territorial behavior and occupancy of 48 males and 34 females throughout the nonbreeding and breeding seasons. We tested the importance of territory switching, mate advertisement, foray behavior, and role of floaters. In seven of the removal experiments, both members of a pair were radiotagged and tracked throughout the duration of the experiments. It was predicted that widowed birds would attempt to attract a new mate through increased song rate or unique vocalizations; however, that behavior was not observed in White-bellied Antbirds. We documented a weak response in floaters to territorial vacancies and found that territory switching occurs regularly in response to experimental removals and naturally within populations. We found density of birds in an area influences the probability of replacement and is likely a reflection of territory quality given that birds in high-density areas were in better physical condition, spent less time off-territory, and competed more for those territories. Telemetry revealed that individuals made silent extraterritorial forays during the nonbreeding season. Birds could use those forays to assess the quality and status of neighboring territories and to find food during this period when food abundance is low. Several birds were observed to temporarily abandon territorial behavior for periods from 2 to 13 months, a previously undocumented behavior in this type of territorial system.},

abstract={American Dippers concentrate on low-elevation streams during fall and winter in many parts of their range; however the breeding origin relative to the wintering location is poorly understood. Our objectives were to identify seasonal changes in the density and distribution of American Dippers, to classify the migratory behavior of the local population, and to determine the origin of winter migrants within a coastal watershed of British Columbia, Canada. During 1999-2002, we color banded 522 dippers and radio-tagged 14 in the Chilliwack River watershed. Using mark-resighting techniques, we identified peak densities on the main river during early November (9.8 ± 1.4 [SE] birds per stream km), which was nearly 5 times higher than in early July (2.1 ± 0.3 birds per stream km). The watershed's total population size, estimated from November surveys, was 429 ± 64 [SE] dippers in 1999, 682 ± 79 in 2000, 697 ± 123 in 2001, and 550 ± 72 in 2002. The majority (79-90%) of the dipper population seasonally migrated, primarily moving from the main river in fall and winter to the higher-elevation tributaries in spring. The remaining dippers (10-16%) remained resident on the main river year-round. Migrants showed a high degree of winter site fidelity with 67% returning to the same site on the Chilliwack River for 2 or more years. Given the population's defined structure and predictable seasonal movements, this study has implications for applying American Dipper populations as indicators of water and habitat quality in North American watersheds.},

abstract={We examined nesting distribution and demography of the Pacific Coast population of Caspian Terns (Sterna caspia) using breeding records and band recoveries spanning two decades since the first population assessment. Since 1980, population size has more than doubled to about 12 900 pairs, yet the proportion of the population nesting at inland (18%) versus coastal sites (82%) has remained constant. Although the breeding range of the Pacific Coast population has expanded northward into Alaska and farther south in Mexico, there was no net latitudinal shift in the distribution of breeding pairs or new colonies. The distribution of breeding birds among areas changed dramatically, however, with 69% of breeding terns now nesting in Oregon (primarily in the Columbia River estuary) versus 4% during the late 1970s. During the past 20 years, there has continued to be a greater proportion of Caspian Terns breeding at anthropogenic sites compared to natural sites. Estimated annual survival rates for hatch-year and after-third-year birds during 1981-1998 were greater than during 1955-1980, consistent with the higher rate of population increase in recent decades. Fecundity required to maintain a stable population (λ = 1) was estimated at 0.32-0.74 fledglings pair-1, depending on band recovery probabilities for sub-adults. Caspian Terns readily moved among breeding sites and rapidly colonized new areas; however, a greater concentration of breeding Caspian Terns among fewer colonies in response to anthropogenic factors is an important conservation concern for this species.},

abstract={Many of today's agricultural landscapes once held vast amounts of wetland habitat for waterbirds and other wildlife. Successful restoration of these landscapes relies on access to accurate maps of the wetlands that remain. We used C-band (5.6-cm-wavelength), HH-polarized radar remote sensing (RADARSAT) at a 38 degrees incidence angle (8-m resolution) to map the distribution of winter shorebird (Charadriiformes) habitat on agricultural lands in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon. We acquired imagery on three dates (10 December 1999, 27 January 2000, and 15 March 2000) and simultaneously collected ground reference data to classify radar signatures and evaluate map accuracy of four habitat classes: (1) wet with < or = 50% vegetation (considered optimal shorebird habitat), (2) wet with > 50% vegetation, (3) dry with < or = 50% vegetation, and (4) dry with > 50% vegetation. Overall accuracy varied from 45 to 60% among the three images, but the accuracy of focal class 1 was greater, ranging from 72 to 80%. Class 4 coverage was stable and dominated maps (40% of mapped study area) for all three dates, while coverage of class 3 decreased slightly throughout the study period. Among wet classes, class 1 was most abundant (about 30% coverage) in December and January, decreasing in March to approximately 15%. Conversely, class 2 increased dramatically from January to March, likely due to transition from class 1 as vegetation grew. This approach was successful in detecting optimal habitat for shorebirds on agricultural lands. For modest classification schemes, radar remote sensing is a valuable option for wetland mapping in areas where cloud cover is persistent.},

abstract={We used satellite-monitored radiotelemetry to track 14 Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) breeding on three study areas in southern Florida and four Ospreys breeding along the coast of Maine. Seven birds (50%) migrated from Florida to South America and one was tracked along its migration route and at its nonbreeding season destination in successive years. Four (29%) moved from their breeding areas, but stayed in Florida. Two birds (14%) remained in their breeding areas year round. One bird died (7%) before meaningful data could be collected. Ospreys migrating to South America left their nesting grounds 16 July-27 August and arrived on South American nonbreeding areas 31 July-11 September. The seven Ospreys spent between 142-180 d in South America and initiated northward migration 10-31 January. On average they traveled 4105 km, taking 25 d (N = 7), with a mean speed of 178 km/d (N = 5). Ospreys that remained in Florida departed nesting areas 13 May-20 July. Departure from Florida nonbreeding areas was between 28 October and 9 December (N = 4). Mean time spent on nonbreeding areas in Florida was 154 d (N = 3). From Maine, two birds went to Florida (St. Lucie and Indian River counties) and two went to the Caribbean (Haiti and Jamaica). These data show that some southern Florida breeding Ospreys migrate to South America, and some northern breeding Ospreys winter in Florida. © 2004 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={The Eastern Prairie Population (EPP) of Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior) nests in the Hudson Bay lowlands of Manitoba and migrates through south-central Manitoba, western Minnesota, and Iowa, with a wintering terminus primarily in Missouri, Arkansas, and southern Illinois. The southern range of the EPP historically extended through Arkansas and along coastal southwestern Louisiana and Texas. However, during the 1950s and 1960s a progressive northern shift in wintering distribution occurred as numbers of geese wintering in Louisiana and Arkansas declined while numbers wintering in Missouri increased. Continued temporal and geographic shifts in fall and winter distributions were suspected during the 1980s when numbers of wintering Canada geese increased in Minnesota and declined in Missouri. However, concurrent increases in numbers of Mississippi Valley Population (MVP; B. c. interior) and Mississippi Flyway Giant Population (MFGP; B. c. maxima) Canada geese in portions of the winter range shared with EPP geese confounded interpretations of winter population and harvest surveys. During 1984-93, researchers conducted a cooperative banding and observation effort to improve information on survival rates, harvest rates, and winter distributions of EPP Canada geese. Consistent harvest regulations within 3-year periods during 1984-93, combined with extensive observations of marked geese, allowed for an integrative analysis of survival and movements of this population relative to changes in harvest pressure. We used observations, recaptures, and hunter recoveries of marked geese to provide information on survival, harvest, and movements of the EPP that is needed for long-term management of this population. Annual survival rates of neck-banded adult geese averaged (x̄ ± SE) 0.707 ± 0.019 during 1984-86, 0.651 ± 0.022 during 1987-89 when harvest seasons were restricted, and 0.595 ± 0.028 during 1990-93 when harvest seasons were liberalized. Annual survival rates for neck-banded adults were lower versus leg-banded adults during 1987-89 and 1990-93 (P ≤ 0.05). Mean survival of neck-banded adults during the harvest seasons in 1987-89 was lower than the mean rate in the harvest seasons of 1984-86, primarily due to a low survival estimate in 1989. Survival averaged 0.918 ± 0.0129 during the 1987 and 1988 harvest seasons but declined to 0.665 ± 0.051 during 1989. Restrictions in harvest correlated with a decrease in direct recovery rates and an increase in survival rates of neck-banded adults during the 1987 and 1988 harvest seasons, but not in 1989. Higher recovery rates in 1989-92 suggested that increased harvest mortality contributed to lower survival of adult geese. However, mortality rates during the 1989-92 harvest seasons increased at a greater proportion than increases in direct recovery rates, suggesting that factors other than harvest could have significantly impacted fall mortality rates of adult geese. Estimated within-year probabilities of movement, along with population size estimates, suggested there was a northern shift in fall distributions of EPP Canada geese and delayed migrations during the late 1980s. Probabilities of southward movement for geese in the northern regions of the Flyway declined significantly during October and November when season lengths and quotas were reduced during 1987-89. While restrictions in harvest in 1987-89 corresponded with delays in fall movements, subsequent increases in harvest pressure in 1990-92 did not promote southward movement of geese in early fall. Geese that survived the harvest season in 1990-92 had lower rates of movement during October and early November than did geese that survived the harvest seasons in 1985-86. The gradual shift in the estimated timing of north-south movement, for birds known to have survived the harvest season, suggests mortality rates were higher for geese that moved south early in the fall in 1990-92. However, the lack of information on reporting rates and crippling loss for Canada geese prevented direct estimation of the proportion of fall mortality attributable to harvest. Our study demonstrated that a variety of factors can interact to affect the distribution of Canada geese and complicate approaches to population management Information from marked geese is a critical tool for monitoring changes in survival and harvest rates of Canada goose populations, especially in light of recent changes in winter distributions and resultant mixing of populations. Data for EPP Canada geese indicated that neck-banded geese had lower survival and higher recovery rates than did leg-banded geese. If harvest was the major source of mortality for EPP geese, our results suggested that actual reporting rates for Canada geese were lower than rates estimated for mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). In contrast, if harvest was not the major source of mortality for geese, then managers need to consider nonharvest mortality rates when determining optimal harvest rates for sustainable populations of Canada geese. In light of recent changes in band inscriptions designed to increase reporting rates, we recommend that managers limit the use of neck bands and that monitoring programs for Canada geese be designed to minimize potential biases due to colored auxiliary markers and differential reporting rates. We also recommend that band reporting rates be evaluated for goose populations across North America. Information on temporal and spatial differences in reporting rates would improve management efforts for EPP Canada geese by allowing a better understanding of the relative impacts of harvest and nonharvest mortality rates.},

abstract={Associations between spatial distribution of harvest and harvest regulations are an important consideration in the management of midcontinent and eastern populations of mallards (Anas platyrynchos), especially if regional harvest allocation is an explicit harvest management objective. I used categorical data analysis and bootstrap techniques to compare the distribution of harvest between a 10-year period of restrictive hunting regulations (1985-1994) and a subsequent 5-year period of liberal regulations (1995-1999). I focused my analyses on breeding populations of importance to the Mississippi (MF) and Atlantic Flyways (AF). I found that liberal hunting regulations were associated with increases in proportion of harvest of midcontinent mallard populations in both northern and southern regions of the MF relative to harvest proportions in Canada and the northern Central Flyway (CF). Relative proportion of the harvest of eastern Canada populations increased with liberal regulations in the northern AF. I detected no change in harvest distribution of birds breeding in the Great Lakes region. Redistribution of harvest between study periods coincides with a general decrease in hunting effort and harvest in Canadian provinces. Despite a decrease in the proportion of hunting effort in the northern versus southern region of the AF during 1995-1999, the relative proportion of harvest increased in the northern region. These results and methodology could be used to help inform components of the Adaptive Harvest Management (AHM) process that require knowledge and prediction of regional harvest distribution.},

abstract={Forest-associated species in fragmented landscapes must traverse potentially inhospitable gaps to move between habitat patches. Although conservation biologists advocate connecting patches with corridors or improving the matrix to make it suitable for movement, little is known about the factors influencing gap-crossing decisions for most species. We investigated gap crossing by the red squirrel (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) in logged landscapes in southeastern Alaska, where the species avoids microhabitats associated with gaps created by clearcutting. We released individuals across clearcuts and determined the routes they took home with tracking spools and radio telemetry. Of 36 adult red squirrels translocated across six clearcuts, 14 crossed clearcuts to reach home. Squirrels were more likely to cross clearcuts if the detour efficiency (distance to home crossing gap divided by distance of forested detour) was low, indicating an ability to compare distances along alternate routes and travel costs or risks in different habitats. No other landscape metrics, such as gap size or crossing distance, predicted crossing behavior. Red squirrels of low body mass were more likely to cross clearcuts, where the probability of encountering conspecifics is low. Distance predicted route choice for squirrels detouring around clearcuts. Indirect evidence suggests that perceived predation risk, energetic costs, or both are higher in clearcuts. Detour efficiency reportedly influences the gap-crossing decisions of some forest-associated birds, but this is the first demonstration of its role in gap-crossing decisions by a mammal.},

abstract={Few if any studies have examined the influence of a recently implemented hunting season on harvest characteristics of mourning doves (Zenaida macroura). We conducted a reward banding study in Ohio, USA, during 1996-1998 to compare harvest rates in urban and rural areas and to estimate overall harvest rate and band-reporting rate. Estimates from band-recovery models provided strong evidence for site- and year-specific variation in harvest rates of doves captured at urban and rural sites. Annual harvest-rate estimates ranged from 0.006 (95% CI: 0.001 to 0.011) to 0.011 (95% CI: 0.005 to 0.018) for birds captured at urban sites, and from 0.034 (95% CI: 0.022 to 0.045) to 0.054 (95% CI: 0.039 to 0.069) for birds captured at rural sites. The estimated reporting rate of 0.208 (95% CI: 0.142 to 0.274) was less than previously published estimates, probably because of a lack of familiarity of hunters with dove bands. In our study, >80% of the harvest of banded birds occurred in Ohio, suggesting that hunting pressure on this population is largely determined by Ohio hunters. Increased understanding of the role of urban landscapes as potential refuges from hunting pressure will improve our ability to manage dove harvests. Large-scale banding studies are needed to obtain contemporary estimates of harvest parameters, which are necessary for more informed harvest management of mourning doves.},

abstract={We experimentally evaluated alternative techniques of attaching radiotransmitters to captive white-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica) in Kingsville, Texas during 1998.

abstract={We constructed a linear, discrete-time, 3-age-class population model for peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus anatum) in Colorado, USA, from estimates of survival and reproduction derived from banded birds (1973-2001) and monitored nests (1989-2001). Survival estimates were 0.544 ± 0.077 for 0-1-year-old birds, 0.670 ± 0.098 for 1-2 year olds, and 0.800 ± 0.054 for birds >2 years of age. Average young produced per pair was 1.660 (SE = 0.044), but we found considerable variation across years (minimum = 1.388 ± 0.155 in 1995; maximum = 2.122 ± 0.139 in 2000). The population model constructed from these estimates predicted an annual rate of population increase of 1.029 if females were to reproduce at 3 years of age, and 1.080 if they first reproduced at 2 years of age. With appropriate estimates of population parameters, our model provides a method for managers to estimate impacts of falconry harvest upon wild peregrine stocks.},

abstract={The Eastern Prairie Population (EPP) of Canada geese (Branta canadensis interior) nests in the Hudson Bay lowlands of Manitoba and migrates through south-central Manitoba, western Minnesota, and Iowa, with a wintering terminus primarily in Missouri, Arkansas, and southern Illinois. The southern range of the EPP historically extended through Arkansas and along coastal southwestern Louisiana and Texas. However, during the 1950s and 1960s a progressive northern shift in wintering distribution occurred as numbers of geese wintering in Louisiana and Arkansas declined while numbers wintering in Missouri increased. Continued temporal and geographic shifts in fall and winter distributions were suspected during the 1980s when numbers of wintering Canada geese increased in Minnesota and declined in Missouri. However, concurrent increases in numbers of Mississippi Valley Population (MVP; B. c. interior) and Mississippi Flyway Giant Population (MFGP; B. c. maxima) Canada geese in portions of the winter range shared with EPP geese confounded interpretations of winter population and harvest surveys. During 1984-93, researchers conducted a cooperative banding and observation effort to improve information on survival rates, harvest rates, and winter distributions of EPP Canada geese. Consistent harvest regulations within 3-year periods during 1984-93, combined with extensive observations of marked geese, allowed for an integrative analysis of survival and movements of this population relative to changes in harvest pressure. We used observations, recaptures, and hunter recoveries of marked geese to provide information on survival, harvest, and movements of the EPP that is needed for long-term management of this population. Annual survival rates of neck-banded adult geese averaged (x̄ ± SE) 0.707 ± 0.019 during 1984-86, 0.651 ± 0.022 during 1987-89 when harvest seasons were restricted, and 0.595 ± 0.028 during 1990-93 when harvest seasons were liberalized. Annual survival rates for neck-banded adults were lower versus leg-banded adults during 1987-89 and 1990-93 (P ≤ 0.05). Mean survival of neck-banded adults during the harvest seasons in 1987-89 was lower than the mean rate in the harvest seasons of 1984-86, primarily due to a low survival estimate in 1989. Survival averaged 0.918 ± 0.0129 during the 1987 and 1988 harvest seasons but declined to 0.665 ± 0.051 during 1989. Restrictions in harvest correlated with a decrease in direct recovery rates and an increase in survival rates of neck-banded adults during the 1987 and 1988 harvest seasons, but not in 1989. Higher recovery rates in 1989-92 suggested that increased harvest mortality contributed to lower survival of adult geese. However, mortality rates during the 1989-92 harvest seasons increased at a greater proportion than increases in direct recovery rates, suggesting that factors other than harvest could have significantly impacted fall mortality rates of adult geese. Estimated within-year probabilities of movement, along with population size estimates, suggested there was a northern shift in fall distributions of EPP Canada geese and delayed migrations during the late 1980s. Probabilities of southward movement for geese in the northern regions of the Flyway declined significantly during October and November when season lengths and quotas were reduced during 1987-89. While restrictions in harvest in 1987-89 corresponded with delays in fall movements, subsequent increases in harvest pressure in 1990-92 did not promote southward movement of geese in early fall. Geese that survived the harvest season in 1990-92 had lower rates of movement during October and early November than did geese that survived the harvest seasons in 1985-86. The gradual shift in the estimated timing of north-south movement, for birds known to have survived the harvest season, suggests mortality rates were higher for geese that moved south early in the fall in 1990-92. However, the lack of information on reporting rates and crippling loss for Canada geese prevented direct estimation of the proportion offall mortality attributable to harvest. Our study demonstrated that a variety of factors can interact to affect the distribution of Canada geese and complicate approaches to population management. Information from marked geese is a critical tool for monitoring changes in survival and harvest rates of Canada goose populations, especially in light of recent changes in winter distributions and resultant mixing of populations. Data for EPP Canada geese indicated that neck-banded geese had lower survival and higher recovery rates than did leg-banded geese. If harvest was the major source of mortality for EPP geese, our results suggested that actual reporting rates for Canada geese were lower than rates estimated for mallards (Anas platyrhynchos). In contrast, if harvest was not the major source of mortality for geese, then managers need to consider nonharvest mortality rates when determining optimal harvest rates for sustainable populations of Canada geese. In light of recent changes in band inscriptions designed to increase reporting rates, we recommend that managers limit the use of neck bands and that monitoring programs for Canada geese be designed to minimize potential biases due to colored auxiliary markers and differential reporting rates. We also recommend that band reporting rates be evaluated for goose populations across North America. Information on temporal and spatial differences in reporting rates would improve management efforts for EPP Canada geese by allowing a better understanding of the relative impacts of harvest and nonharvest mortality rates.},

The technique involves color-anodized aluminum bands (unnumbered blanks and federal numbered bands), with auto pin-striping tape and flexible epoxy sealant, to create a variety of solid, half- and triple-split colors. This allows for hundreds of unique, high-contrast color combinations. During six consecutive years of application, these colored metal bands have resisted color fade compared to conventional celluloid-plastic bands, and have reduced leg injuries in the flycatcher. Although not necessarily warranted for all color-banding studies, these metal bands may provide a lower-impact option for studies of species known to be impacted by plastic color bands.},

abstract={We report survival probabilities for 148 breeding adult Atlantic Puffins (Fratercula arctica) monitored through capture-mark-resight at two colonies for 11 years (1992-2003). The colonies, Eastern Egg Rock and Seal Island, are ∼42 km apart in the Gulf of Maine. Support for competing models in the program MARK suggests constant survival of 0.95 ± 0.01 (SE) that is independent of colony. Our high survival probability is consistent with published estimates for Atlantic Puffins and other long-lived seabirds. No time-variance contrasts with many long-term seabird studies, which often report high survival in most years, broken occasionally by low-survival events. However, a post-hoc observation of survival estimates from the time-dependent model suggests that there may have been at least two low-survival events in our time-series; sparse data may have precluded detection by our models. In this study, each bird received an individually engraved, plastic, field-readable leg band, as well as the standard metal band. Using an index of band readability, we show that plastic bands wore rapidly, resulting in accumulating losses of engraved characters through time. Degradation and loss of marks is a common source of overdispersion in capture-mark-re-encounter data and results in underestimated sampling variances. In the presence of a 70% reduction in band readability over eight years, an estimate of the adjusted overdispersion factor (ĉ = 1.14) identified very little overdispersion in our data. Overdispersion was avoided by double banding and intensively resighting metal bands. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2005.},

We compared daily nest survival rates for 66 nests of radio-marked birds with 59 nests of birds found through systematic searching. By using radio-telemetry, we found Wood Thrush nests in higher elevation pine habitats, in addition to the more usual hardwood forests with moist soils. We found nests of radio-marked birds farther from streams than nests found by systematic searching. Thirty-two percent of radio-marked birds' nests were found at the tops of slopes, compared to 15% of the nests found by traditional searching. In addition, radio-marked birds generally moved up-slope for re-nesting attempts. Although the distribution of nests found with telemetry and searching varied, daily nest survival did not vary between the two groups. Radio-telemetry provided new information about Wood Thrush nesting habitats. We believe radio-telemetry can be a valuable addition to traditional searching techniques; it has the potential to provide a sample of nests free from a priori habitat biases.},

abstract={A complete understanding of animal dispersal requires knowledge not only of its consequences at population and community levels, but also of the behavioural decisions made by dispersing individuals. Recent theoretical work has emphasised the importance of this dispersal process, particularly the phase in which individuals search the landscape for breeding opportunities. However, empirical advances are currently hampered by a lack of tools for quantifying these dispersal search tactics. Here, we review existing methods for quantifying movement that are appropriate for the dispersal search process, describe several new techniques that we developed for characterising movement and behaviour through an individual's dispersal range, and illustrate their use with data from Australasian treecreepers (Climacteridae). We also describe how the quantitative parameters we discuss are calculated in a freely available computer software package that we designed. Specifically, we present methods for calculating the area searched during dispersal, search rate, thoroughness, intensity, philopatry of search, timing of exploration, and surreptitiousness. When we applied this approach to the study of dispersal in treecreepers, we found that search area, philopatry and timing of exploration showed the greatest individual variation. Furthermore, search area, search rate, thoroughness and philopatry of search were all correlated, suggesting they may be useful parameters for further research on the causes and consequences of different dispersal search tactics. Finally, we make recommendations for modifying radiotracking protocols to facilitate more accurate assessment of individual variation in the dispersal process, and suggest future directions for this type of empirical work at the interface of population and behavioural ecology. © Springer-Verlag 2004.},

At Desolation Sound, these methods each produced a similar distribution of nesting dates, but at Clayoquot Sound, the distribution of nesting dates of radio-tracked birds were substantially biased towards later nests. Despite these methodological difficulties, we found that Marbled Murrelets at Desolation Sound bred ca. 30 d later than at Clayoquot Sound. Regional differences in breeding chronology of this magnitude, if not properly calibrated, would bias estimates of peak inland activity, and should be considered in forestry operations, the interpretation of census data, and the design of monitoring programs.},

abstract={Information on population connectivity throughout the annual cycle has become more crucial, because populations of many migratory birds are in decline. One such species is the American Woodcock (Scolopax minor), which inhabits early-successional forests in eastern North America. Although band recoveries have proved useful for dividing populations of this game bird species into an Eastern Region and Central Region for management purposes, these data do not provide enough detail to determine the breeding population of origin of birds recovered on stopover and wintering areas. To obtain more fine-scale data, we undertook a phylogeographic study of American Woodcock populations throughout their primary breeding range in the eastern United States and Canada using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from the hypervariable control region I (CRI) and ND6 gene. Despite high haplotype diversity, nucleotide diversity was low and there was no phylogeographic structure among American Woodcock populations across the species range, with birds from many states and provinces in both management regions sharing identical haplotypes. Results suggest recent or ongoing gene flow among populations, with asymmetric movement of birds between migration flyways. As has been demonstrated for several other avian species in North America, American Woodcock appear to have undergone a rapid population expansion following the late Pleistocene glacial retreat. Thus, a combination of historical demographic factors and recent or ongoing gene flow mask any population structure based on mtDNA that might accrue from philopatry to breeding areas observed in studies of marked birds. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2005.},

abstract={We report first-year survival for 34 captive-reared Puerto Rican Parrots (Amazona vittata) released in the Caribbean National Forest, Puerto Rico between 2000 and 2002. The purpose of the releases were to increase population size and the potential number of breeding individuals of the sole extant wild population, and to refine release protocols for eventual reintroduction of a second wild population elsewhere on the island. After extensive prerelease training, we released 10 parrots in 2000, 16 parrots in 2001, and eight parrots in 2002 ranging in age from 1-4 years old. All birds were equipped with radio-transmitters to monitor survival. The overall first-year survival estimate for the 34 parrots was 41% (CI = 22%-61%). Only one parrot died within the first week postrelease, with most (94%) surviving for at least eight weeks after release. Most (54%) documented mortalities were due to raptor predation, which claimed 21% of all released parrots. A captive-reared bird (male, age one), released in 2001, paired with a wild female and fledged two young in 2004. We also calculated survival based on 0% and 50% of observed predation losses and found hypothetical survival rates of 72% and 54%, respectively. Rigorous prerelease training and acclimation was believed to have improved initial postrelease parrot survival, and releasing mixed age-class groups suggests the potential for shortening the time to recruitment. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2005.},

abstract={There is no formal population survey specifically designed to index population abundance of band-tailed pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata) throughout their range. Data from the Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), Washington and Oregon Mineral-Site (WAORMS) surveys, and Washington Call Count (WACC) survey offer evidence of long-term population decline. We investigated the potential to augment BBS, WACC, and WAORMS surveys to provide more precise population indices for the Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeon (P. f. monilis) and augment the BBS to index the Interior or "Four Corners" population (P. f. fasciata). We calculated statistical power, the probability of detecting population change given that a change exists, and analyzed survey data to investigate the effect of route length, survey repetition, and sample size. Sample sizes of 50 sites or routes yielded corresponding powers of 99% for WAORMS, 54% for WACC, and 30% for Pacific BBS, to detect a 10% annual change over a 5-year period (a = 0.10). Route length and repetition of surveys had little impact on power. Mineral-site surveys provide the greatest potential to monitor breeding populations and detect short-term trends in the Pacific Coast population. New survey techniques are needed for the Interior band-tailed pigeon.},

abstract={We monitored radio-tagged Harlequin Ducks (Histrionicus histrionicus) to determine whether nocturnal feeding was part of their foraging strategy during winter in south-central Alaska. Despite attributes of our study site (low ambient temperatures, harsh weather, short day length) and study species (small body size, high daytime foraging rates) that would be expected to favor nocturnal foraging, we found no evidence of nocturnal dive-feeding. Signals from eight radio-tagged Harlequin Ducks never exhibited signal loss due to diving during a total of 780 minutes of nocturnal monitoring. In contrast, the same eight birds exhibited signal loss during 62 ± 7% (SE) of 5-minute diurnal monitoring periods (total of 365 minutes of monitoring). Our results suggest that Harlequin Ducks in south-central Alaska face a stringent time constraint on daytime foraging during midwinter. Harlequin Ducks wintering at high latitudes, therefore, may be particularly sensitive to factors that increase foraging requirements or decrease foraging efficiency.},

abstract={Most work on the effects of land-cover change on tropical birds has focused on forest-interior birds because these species are assumed to be the most severely affected by forest loss. However, even species that use human-altered habitat types may be severely affected by forest loss. White-throated Robins (Turdus assimilis) frequently nest in coffee and pasture in southern Costa Rica, although several lines of evidence suggest the species could not exist solely in agricultural habitat. We used radio-telemetry to examine the area and proportion of different habitat types used by adult White-throated Robins. Mean area of use for the tracking period was 0.26 km2 and varied from 0.07 to 0.58 km2. No robins had areas of use solely in either primary forest or agricultural cover, although individuals were initially captured in both primary forest and a coffee plantation. All areas of use contained some forest, pasture, and coffee or regenerating forest. The mean percentages of the habitat types used by the birds were fairly equal with 30% forest, 33% pasture, and 38% coffee or regenerating forest. Our results, combined with other evidence, indicate that the White-throated Robin uses multiple habitat types but that it may require some threshold level of forest to sustain viable populations.},

abstract={Resource-selection studies of passerine birds during the breeding season have mainly been limited to understanding those factors important to nesting. However, little is known about what resources are selected by juveniles that are no longer dependent on their parents. The postfledging period may be a critical part of the breeding season for independent juveniles because they must avoid predators and learn to forage on a changing resource base. We used radio-telemetry to study postfledging habitat use and resource selection of juvenile Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) in coastal California from 2000 to 2002. We generated population-level contours (50% and 95% fixed-kernel) to describe habitat use by independent juveniles, and we determined juvenile resource selection by comparing vegetation characteristics at sites used by juveniles versus random sites. Juvenile Swainson's Thrushes used mixed-hardwood forest and coastal scrub during the postfledging period as well as riparian vegetation used by nesting adults. The most parsimonious predictors of resource selection were fruit abundance variables, suggesting that postfledging habitat selection by the Swainson's Thrush is best explained by the optimal-foraging hypothesis. We suggest that juvenile thrushes can track food resources in a habitat mosaic and use vegetation types distinct from what is traditionally considered Swainson's Thrush breeding habitat. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2005.},

abstract={In Saskatchewan, at the northern edge of the species' range, the Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) is an irruptive species that has appeared in numbers during major vole (Microtus) outbreaks in 4 of 44 years. Seven other years have had either no bandings or no sightings over large areas. In a search for possible evidence of food-based nomadism, population trends, length and synchronicity of cycles, and longevity, I reviewed all banding in North America through 1998. Prior to banding office computerization (retroactive to 1955), 803 Long-eared Owls had been banded with 33 band encounters (4.1%). Between 1955 and 1998 there were another 10 250 banded by 426 banders with 86 band encounters (0.8%). Encounter records, especially those involving unexpected directions and distances, tend to support but do not prove food-based nomadism. Peaks of migration movements at different long-term stations occurred in different years. There is soft evidence of both 10- and 3-yr cycles. There is inconclusive evidence for a continuing population decline. The oldest banded bird in North America lived for 11 years, 1 month, but another possibly lived for 15 years, 8 months.},

abstract={Movement ecology and demographic parameters for the Common Merganser (Mergus merganser americanus) in North America are poorly known. We used band-recovery data from five locations across North America spanning the years 1938-1998 to examine migratory patterns and estimate survival rates. We examined competing time-invariant, age-graduated models with program MARK to study sources of variation in survival and reporting probability. We considered age, sex, geographic location, and the use of nasal saddles on hatching year birds at one location as possible sources of variation. Year-of-banding was included as a covariate in a post-hoc analysis. We found that migratory tendency, defined as the average distance between banding and recovery locations, varied geographically. Similarly, all models accounting for the majority of variation in recovery and survival probabilities included location of banding. Models that included age and sex received less support, but we lacked sufficient data to adequately assess these parameters. Model-averaged estimates of annual survival ranged from 0.21 in Michigan to 0.82 in Oklahoma. Heterogeneity in migration tendency and survival suggests that demographic patterns may vary across geographic scales, with implications for the population dynamics of this species.},

abstract={From 1999-2003, we tracked movements of adult female Prairie Falcons (Falco mexicanus) using satellite telemetry to characterize long-range movement patterns and breeding dispersal. We radio marked 40 falcons from April-May on their nesting grounds in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area in southwest Idaho. All falcons with functioning transmitters left the Snake River Canyon from late June through mid-July. Most headed northeast across the Continental Divide to summering areas in Montana, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and the Dakotas. Prairie Falcons stayed at their northern summer areas for 1-4 months before heading to the southern Great Plains or to southwest Idaho. The Great Plains was a key migration pathway. Important wintering areas included the Texas Panhandle and southwest Idaho. Most falcons completed their seasonal migrations within 2 weeks. Use of widely separated nesting, summering, and wintering areas appears to be a strategy to exploit seasonally abundant prey resources. Most falcons had three or fewer use areas during the nonbreeding season, and falcons showed a high degree of fidelity to their use areas during each season. At least 21 falcons returned to nest within 2.5 km of where they nested in the previous year, but one falcon moved to a new nesting area 124 km south of her previous breeding area. Prairie Falcon movements suggest large-scale connectivity of grassland and shrubsteppe landscapes throughout western North America. Conservation of Prairie Falcons must be an international effort that considers habitats used during both nesting and non-nesting seasons. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2005.},

abstract={Rapid development of energy reserves in the boreal forest of western Canada has raised concerns about the potential impacts of forest fragmentation caused by seismic lines. Seismic lines are narrow linear corridors cut by the energy sector to access remote areas. Traditionally, seismic lines were cut using a bulldozer and averaged about 8 m in width. In response to concerns about conventional seismic line impacts, some energy companies have turned to new "best practices" that use lower-impact techniques to reduce their footprint (2- to 3-m-wide lines). Crucial to assessing the efficacy of this change in seismic policy for maintenance of biodiversity is determining how conventional and low-impact seismic lines are perceived by wildlife. We assessed the functional and numerical response of male ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) to conventional and low-impact seismic lines in mature aspen forest in northeastern Alberta. Based on radio-telemetry, ovenbirds perceived conventional seismic lines as creating a gap in the forest and used it as a territory boundary. In contrast, ovenbirds incorporated low-impact seismic lines within their territories. Spot-mapping data suggested no differences in ovenbird density in stands with a single conventional seismic line, multiple low-impact lines, or reference plots with no seismic lines. Despite the lack of numerical response to any seismic practice, we believe it is prudent to recommend that energy companies consider using new low-impact approaches in their seismic operations to minimize the ecological risks of energy sector activity for forest birds.},

abstract={Speed (km/hr) during flight is one of several factors determining the rate of migration (km/ day) and flight range of birds. We attached 26-g, back-mounted satellite-received radio tags (platform transmitting terminals; PTTs) to adult female Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) during (1) midwinter 2000-2003 in the northern Central Valley of California, (2) fall and winter 2002-2003 in the Playa Lakes Region and Gulf Coast of Texas, and (3) early fall 2002-2003 in south-central New Mexico. We tracked tagged birds after release and, in several instances, obtained multiple locations during single migratory flights (flight paths). We used data from 17 PTT-tagged hens along 21 migratory flight paths to estimate groundspeeds during spring (n = 19 flights) and fall (n = 2 flights). Pintails migrated at an average groundspeed of 77 ± 4 (SE) km/hr (range for individual flight paths = 40-122 km/hr), which was within the range of estimates reported in the literature for migratory and local flights of waterfowl (42-116 km/hr); further, groundspeed averaged 53 ± 6 km/hr in headwinds and 82 ± 4 km/hr in tailwinds. At a typical, but hypothetical, flight altitude of 1,460 m (850 millibars standard pressure), 17 of the 21 flight paths occurred in tailwinds with an average airspeed of 55 ± 4 km/hr, and 4 occurred in headwinds with an average airspeed of 71 ± 4 km/hr. These adjustments in airspeed and groundspeed in response to wind suggest that pintails migrated at airspeeds that on average maximized range and conserved energy, and fell within the range of expectations based on aerodynamic and energetic theory.},

abstract={We used radio telemetry to examine Savannah Sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis) home-range size and foraging and roosting behavior on Padre Island National Seashore in south Texas during January and February, 2002 and 2003. Savannah Sparrows maintained fixed home ranges in winter. Mean home-range size (95% Kernel Home Range [KHR]) was 9.1 ha with a mean core area (50% KHR) of 0.9 ha. Within home ranges, mean foraging and roosting areas were 5.6 and 6.6 ha, respectively. Three distinct habitat types were used by Savannah Sparrows on the island: foredunes (adjacent to the ocean), interior grasslands, and lagoons. Birds using the foredunes had significantly larger home ranges and traveled longer distances between their foraging and roosting locations, always moving inland to roost. Roosting and foraging areas overlapped less for these birds (20%) compared with the overlap for birds found in interior grasslands (45%) and lagoons (55%). The greater distance traveled to roost sites by birds foraging in the foredune habitat appeared to be related to increased exposure in that habitat type. Savannah Sparrows selected foraging areas with less vegetative biomass and more bare ground than random sites. Roost sites had greater total (live) cover than foraging and random sites. Savannah Sparrows foraged alone or in loose aggregations with conspecifics. Birds roosted alone or in aggregations of up to 30 individuals. Savannah Sparrows often roost outside of their foraging areas; this study draws attention to differences in space use for roosting and foraging Savannah Sparrows. Although Savannah Sparrows maintained relatively small home ranges, they occasionally moved at larger spatial scales, suggesting a need for intact grassland patches much larger than the average home-range size.},

abstract={Because of their smaller size and isolation, island populations tend to be more divergent and less genetically variable than mainland populations. We collected DNA samples from nine Galápagos Hawk (Buteo galapagoensis) island populations, covering the species' entire range. Neutral minisatellite DNA markers were used to calculate within-island genetic diversity and between-island genetic differentiation (FST). Typically, these markers mutate too quickly to be informative in such studies. However, in very small, isolated populations, concerns about high mutational rate are obviated by the relative force of genetic drift. Individuals within islands had the highest levels of reported genetic uniformity of any natural bird population, with mean within-population band-sharing similarity values ranging from 0.693 to 0.956, increasing with decreasing island size. Galapagos Hawks exhibit cooperative polyandry to varying degrees across islands; however, we did not find an association between degree of polyandry and genetic variability. Between-island FST values ranged from 0.017 to 0.896, with an overall archipelago value of 0.538; thus, most populations were genetically distinct. Also, we documented higher levels of genetic similarity between nearby populations. Our results indicated negligible gene flow among most Galapagos Hawk populations, and genetic drift has played a strong role in determining structure at these minisatellite loci. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2005.},

abstract={Avian visual sensitivity encompasses both the human visible range (400-700 nm) and also near-ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths (320-400 nm) invisible to normal humans. I used reflectance spectrophotometry to assess variation in UV reflectance for yellow, orange and red plumage in 67 species of tanager (Passeriformes). Previous chemical studies, and my analysis of reflectance minima, suggest that carotenoids are the dominant pigments in yellow, orange and red tanager plumage. Spectra recorded over the range of wavelengths to which birds are sensitive (320-700 nm) were invariably bimodal, with both a plateau of high reflectance at longer (> 500 nm) wavelengths and a distinct secondary peak at UV (< 400 nm) wavelengths. Within this overall framework, variation in UV reflectance was expressed within well-defined quantitative limits: (1) peak reflectance was always lower than the corresponding plateau of reflectance at longer visible wavelengths; (2) the intensity of peak reflectance declined steadily below 350 nm; (3) wavelengths of peak reflectance clustered between 350 and 370 nm. Significant correlations were detected between various measures of total reflectance in the UV and visible wavebands, but not between various measures of spectral location of UV and visible reflectance. I propose that the strong absorption band at short visible wave-lengths (∼ 380-550 nm) responsible for bimodal spectra of carotenoids in vitro is also responsible for bimodal reflectance by carotenoid-based plumage colours. The construction of the UV and visible reflectance bands from different sides of this same absorbance band provides a mechanism for the observed covariation between UV and visible wave-lengths. Lack of an association between the spectral locations of the UV and visible reflectance bands may result from the limited variation in spectral location of the UV band. These patterns suggest that plumage colours are subject to constraints, just as are more traditional morphological characters. © 2005 The Linnean Society of London.},

abstract={1. It was once assumed that commercially important fish make up significant portions of seal diets. As a consequence, prior to the 1970s many seal populations were dramatically reduced by rampant slaughtering. Today, seals and other marine mammals are valued components of marine ecosystems and their numbers are carefully managed. To facilitate management, government statutes mandate the systematic monitoring of seal populations. Population estimates are based on counts of hauled-out seals obtained by aerial survey and radio and satellite telemetry; hence, considerable effort has been devoted to finding optimal times for such counts. We have developed a predictive mathematical model of seal haul-out to assist resource managers in the selection of optimal census times. 2. Haul-out depends on a number of environmental variables. Some of these variables, such as wind speed, can be obtained only as historical data or short-range predictions. Others, such as tide height, are deterministic and can be obtained as long-range predictions. 3. We used deterministic environmental variables to develop mathematical models that describe haul-out dynamics of harbour seals Phoca vitulina during the pupping season at a site in Washington, USA. A list of alternative hypotheses for environmental cues gave rise to a suite of competing models. We used information-theoretic model selection techniques to choose the best model. The selected model was a function of tide height and current direction, and explained 40% of the variability in hourly census data. 4. An assumption that the system recovers rapidly after disturbance introduced two time scales. This allowed the differential equation model to be reduced to an algebraic equation. 5. Synthesis and applications. This study demonstrates that resource managers can use a simple algebraic equation based on deterministic environmental variables to predict times at which to census maximal haul-out in harbour seals. At the Washington site, maximal daily haul-outs during pupping season are predicted to occur during receding tides, approximately midway between high and low tides. The largest maximal daily haul-outs during the pupping season are predicted to occur in the last week of July. The environmental factors correlated with haul-out are, however, site-specific; therefore the model developed for the Washington site will not necessarily hold for other haul-out areas. Managers should carry out the model selection procedure separately for each monitored haul-out site. The general methodology employed in this study can be used to make long-range predictions of diurnal movements for a variety of marine birds and mammals. © 2005 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={The Queen Maud Gulf Migratory Bird Sanctuary in Nunavut, in the central Canadian Arctic, is an important breeding area for a variety of species of waterfowl and other wildlife. An assessment of the types and spatial extent of land cover, with a particular emphasis upon wildlife habitat capability, has not been available for this sanctuary, preventing an adequate environmental assessment of proposed changes to the sanctuary's boundaries and limiting attempts to evaluate population trends and the distribution of wildlife species within the sanctuary. LANDSAT Thematic Mapper satellite imagery and digital image processing technology were used to prepare a land cover map for this large and remote area. Data from an examination of a variety of possible image enhancements, three field seasons of ground and aerial inspections of land cover types, and image classification were used to generate a thematic map of land cover types. An accuracy assessment of the classification provided an estimate of the reliability of the land cover map. Thirteen land cover types were identified and mapped, including three turbidity classes of water bodies and 10 terrestrial land cover types. An image enhancement, using power stretches of Bands 4 and 5 and a linear stretch of Band 2, proved to be an excellent means of visually interpreting land cover types and was used to generate colour map plots for field inspections. During the three field seasons, 75 detailed ground visits and 2606 low-level aerial inspections of land cover sites were undertaken. Overall accuracy of the classification of water body turbidity was 84%, with no confusion between turbid and clear lakes. Overall classification accuracy for terrestrial land cover types was 89%, with most of the individual cover types having an estimated accuracy of >80%. The land cover map will provide an effective means of assessing proposed boundary changes when used in conjunction with wildlife data and professional judgment. It will also provide a basis for effective design and evaluation of current and future surveys to monitor wildlife populations within the sanctuary. Similar land cover mapping of other migratory bird sanctuaries using satellite image analysis may be an effective means of evaluating the wildlife habitat of these other important areas.},

abstract={Knowledge of the length of time spent at migratory stopover sites, or stopover duration, can help biologists estimate the total number of birds passing through a site, which in turn can be used to estimate population size. We estimated the stopover duration for 106 radiomarked pectoral sandpipers (Calidris melanotos) in the Lower Mississippi River Alluvial Valley (MAV) during fall migrations in 2001 and 2002. We estimated time-at-site-after-capture by tracking radiomarked birds daily to determine their time of departure from stopover sites. We used length-biased sampling and program DISTANCE to estimate stopover duration from time-at-site-after-capture. Our estimate of stopover duration for pectoral sandpipers in the MAV over all sites and both years was 10.0 days (95% CI = 8.2-11.7). Aerial telemetry relocations from 2002 indicated that many pectoral sandpipers used multiple stopover sites during their migration through the MAV, which suggested that the total time spent by pectoral sandpipers in the MAV during fall migration, or turnover rate, was longer than the stopover duration. Future research should focus on estimating the number of stopover sites used by pectoral sandpipers and determine whether other shorebird species use multiple sites as well. If shorebirds migrating through the MAV stay in the region for a period longer than the 10 days suggested by the Lower Mississippi Valley Joint Venture (LMVJV) Migratory Bird Science Team in their modeling of shorebird energetic requirements, then more habitat may be required by shorebirds during fall migration than the 2,000 ha the group calculated for the MAV.},

abstract={Mid-air collisions with black vultures (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) regularly cause substantial damage to military and civilian aircraft. Information concerning the flight behavior of black and turkey vultures potentially could improve predictive models designed to reduce bird strikes by aircraft. We examined the flight behavior of black and turkey vultures at the Savannah River Site (SRS) in South Carolina, USA, and determined whether flight characteristics were predictable with respect to weather and time variables. We captured birds at their primary roost and subsequently relocated them via aerial telemetry from 11 February 2002 through 29 January 2003. One hundred eighty of 326 locations (55%) for 8 black vultures and 129 of 206 locations (63%) for 5 turkey vultures were of flying birds. Black vultures flew at an average altitude of 169 ± 115 (SD) m above ground level, whereas turkey vulture flight altitude averaged 163 ± 92 m. Our results contrast with those of previous studies that reported less frequent and lower altitude flights. The flight behavior of both species appeared to be influenced minimally by weather and time variables. However, we were unable to construct useful models predicting aspects of flight behavior using the variables we measured (all models had R2 or pseudo R2 values &lt;0.10). We suggest that other factors, such as food availability, inter- and intra-specific interactions, and physiological demands play a larger role in vulture flight behavior than the variables we measured. Our results suggest that the development of bird avoidance strategies by aircraft operators should consider the variability of flight behaviors of black and turkey vultures across their ranges. Future research emphases should shift from examinations of the effects of local conditions on flight behavior to the elucidation of factors contributing to differences in flight behavior among regions.},

abstract={The Canadian Migration Monitoring Network consists of several fixed migration monitoring stations (MMS) that apply constant-effort protocols to track changes in the abundance of migratory birds. Such monitoring will be important for tracking long-term population trends of songbirds, especially for species breeding in remote areas such as the North American boreal forest. The geographical catchment sampled by individual MMS, however, remains largely unknown. Here, we used hydrogen isotope measurements (δD) of feathers of white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) moving through Delta Marsh MMS in Manitoba, Canada, to determine both wintering and breeding ground catchment areas monitored by this station. The δD of tail feathers, collected from spring and fall migrants delineated previous breeding or natal latitudes, ranging from the northern to the southern extremes of the western boreal forest. The δD values of head feathers grown on the wintering grounds and collected during spring migration revealed that individuals wintered in a broad region of the southeastern United States. The isotope data showed no relationship between estimated breeding/natal and wintering latitudes of white-throated sparrow populations. Stable isotope data provided little information on longitude. Band-encounter analyses, however, indicated a clear east-west segregation of these sparrows across Canada, supporting connectivity among breeding/natal and wintering longitudes over the entire scale of this species' range. Isotope analyses of multiple feather types representing different periods and geographic regions of the annual cycle can provide key information on migratory connectivity for species moving through dedicated MMS. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={The wide use of radiotelemetry in avian field studies justifies the continued search for improved methods of attaching transmitters. Subcutaneous implantation of radiotransmitters into the furcular cavity of birds has been proposed to ameliorate many deleterious effects of radiotransmitters (J. Berdeen, South Carolina Cooperative Research Center, personal communication). Using wild adult chukars (Alectoris chukar) brought into captivity, we implanted radiotransmitters subcutaneously into their furcular cavity and compared a suite of behavioral, endocrinological, and physiological measures in implanted chukars with controls. Implanted chukars did not differ from controls in maintenance, agonistic, or reproductive behaviors during 11 weeks of observation. Implanted chukars also did not differ from control chukars in an array of blood values designed to test for infection or implant rejection and did not experience chronic stress based on circulating corticosterone levels. Necropsy indicated complete healing of insertion sites with no signs of infection, foreign body reaction, or rejection. Implanted chukars did not differ from controls in mass, body fat, fecundity, or reproductive condition. We conclude that subcutaneous implantation of radiotransmitters into the furcular cavity was well tolerated by chukars and may prevent deleterious effects associated with other methods of transmitter placement.},

abstract={Many animal surveys to estimate populations or index trends include protocol prohibiting counts during rain but fail to address effects of rainfall preceding the count. Prior research on Pacific Coast band-tailed pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata monilis) documented declines in use of mineral sites during rainfall.

We conducted weekly counts of band-tailed pigeons at 19 Pacific Northwest mineral sites in 2001 and 20 sites in 2002. Results from regression analysis indicated higher counts ≤2 days after rain (11.31±5.00% [x̄±SE]) compared to ≥3 days. Individual index counts conducted ≤2 days after rain were biased high, resulting in reduced ability to accurately estimate population trends. Models of band-tailed pigeon visitation rates throughout the summer showed increased mineral-site counts during both June and August migration periods, relative to the July breeding period. Our research supported previous studies recommending that mineral-site counts used to index the band-tailed pigeon population be conducted during July. We further recommend conducting counts >3 days after rain to avoid weather-related bias in index estimation. The design of other population sampling strategies that rely on annual counts should consider the influence of aberrant weather not only coincident with but also preceding surveys if weather patterns are thought to influence behavior or detection probability of target species.},

abstract={It is critical to understand how radiotransmitters and their attachment techniques impact marked individuals. Many studies of transmitter effects assess only overt, deleterious effects. However, physiological effects caused by attachment techniques might compromise the integrity of resulting information. Our objectives, therefore, were to assess the efficacy of subcutaneous implants and determine the physiological effects on mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) using heterophil:lymphocyte (H:L) ratios, and fecal glucocorticoid measures. We conducted 2 trials with 60 mourning doves; 1 in summer-autumn (trial #1) and 1 in autumn-winter (trial #2). For each trial we assigned 15 male and 15 female doves to either a subcutaneous implant treatment or a control group. During the 2 trials, we observed no differences in body masses, H:L ratios or fecal corticosterone levels between mourning doves with subcutaneous implants and the control group. Given the ultimate use of the information obtained from telemetry projects and cost of the resulting initiatives, expenditures associated with rigorous experimental evaluations can only improve the basis of reliable knowledge used in making resource management decisions.},

abstract={The area used by immature birds from the time they fledge until independence is the post-fledging area (PFA). Published estimates of PEA size (170 ha) are only available from a Northern Goshawk (Accipiter gentilis atricapillus) population in New Mexico and applicability of this estimate to other regions and habitat types is unknown. Our objectives were to estimate PFA size and length of the post-fledging period for Northern Goshawk (A. g. laingi) nests on Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We estimated PFA size from 95% adaptive kernel estimates of telemetry locations from 12 fledglings at 12 nests between 29 June and 2 September 2001-02 (N = 6, 2001; N = 6, 2002). Because our adaptive kernel estimates are based on a small number of locations, we also estimated the precision of these home range estimates using a smoothed bootstrap approach. Almost all (93%) fledgling locations were within 200 m of nests during the early fledgling-dependency period, but less than half (42.4%) of these locations were within this distance during the late fledgling-dependency period. Northern Goshawks departed from PFAs 45.9 ± 1.3 d post-fledging. Mean PFA size was 59.2 ± 16.1 ha, and the bootstrapped variance around PFA estimates ranged from 12.7-1820.8 ha. Our estimate for the mean size of one PFA per nest area for A. g. laingi fledglings on Vancouver Island was much smaller than the mean size estimate reported for A. g. atricapillus in New Mexico. However, management plans should consider nest areas and PFAs to be one functional component of Northern Goshawk breeding habitat and should include multiple alternative nest trees, each with an associated PFA. © 2005 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={In the past decade, there has been growing concern about the rapid degradation of marine ecosystems due to anthropogenic causes. Consequently, identifying priority areas for the conservation of marine biodiversity has become a crucial conservation issue. Taking into account the influence of human population density, we performed complementarity analyses to identify priority areas for the conservation of all coastal marine vertebrate species in Chile (265 species), and evaluated congruence among the different target groups. The distribution ranges of all species were digitized in a geographic information system and analyses were performed on latitudinal bands of 0.5°. Our results show that 12 latitudinal bands (∼16% of all latitudinal bands) are necessary to conserve at least one population of each species. Ten of these bands are irreplaceable, whereas two are flexible. Many of the irreplaceable sites lie within areas that have high human population density. In order to conserve all threatened and endemic species, six and three latitudinal bands are needed, respectively. Four latitudinal bands are needed to represent all species of fish, reptiles, and mammals, whereas nine bands are needed to protect all bird species. Taking flexible sites into account, reserve networks that meet the minimum representation goal for each taxonomic group, and for threatened and endemic species, represent subsets of the 12 latitudinal band network selected for all species. Spatial congruence among reserve networks selected for each target group was relatively low and only significantly higher than random in 9 out of 21 pairwise comparisons. However, with the exception of reptiles, conservation areas selected for different surrogate groups represented other groups relatively well, compared to randomly selected sites. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Understanding and describing the factors that affect avian breeding dispersal are critical for modeling population dynamics and designing conservation strategies. We investigated the hypothesis that dispersal probability and dispersal distance are affected by nesting success and mate fidelity with band-resight data (1998-2003) from burrowing owls (Athene cunicularia (Molina, 1782)) nesting in southern California. Most owls (167 of 253, 66%) remained near their initial nest (<100 m), and those that moved >100 m dispersed 472 ± 65 m (mean ± 1 SE; n = 86). Both female and male owls whose nests failed were more likely to disperse and dispersed longer distances than owls with successful nests. Failed nesting attempts were also associated with an increased probability of divorce, and divorce was related to increased dispersal probabilities and distances. Moreover, female and male owls tended to be more likely to disperse and to disperse greater distances following the death of a mate than those that remained paired. Although dispersal was related to mate fidelity, nesting success remained an important factor affecting dispersal even after controlling for the effects of mate loss. Our results suggest that nesting failure was the primary factor associated with dispersal probability and dispersal distance in burrowing owls in our population. © 2005 NRC.},

abstract={Matrix population models that allow an animal to occupy more than one state over time are important tools for population and evolutionary ecologists. Definition of state can vary, including location for metapopulation models and breeding state for life history models. For populations whose members can be marked and subsequently reencountered, multistate mark-recapture models are available to estimate the survival and transition probabilities needed to construct population models. Multistate models have proved extremely useful in this context, but they often require a substantial amount of data and restrict estimation of transition probabilities to those areas or states subjected to formal sampling effort. At the same time, for many species, there are considerable tag recovery data provided by the public that could be modeled in order to increase precision and to extend inference to a greater number of areas or states. Here we present a statistical model for combining multistate capture-recapture data (e.g., from a breeding ground study) with multistate tag recovery data (e.g., from wintering grounds). We use this method to analyze data from a study of Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) in the Atlantic Flyway of North America. Our analysis produced marginal improvement in precision, due to relatively few recoveries, but we demonstrate how precision could be further improved with increases in the probability that a retrieved tag is reported. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The departure period spanned a 17-day period from 15 September to 5 October, and coincided with a series of environmental changes including decreases in day length, temperature, and prey diversity.

abstract={Bands are a common marking method in bird studies and capture-mark- reencounter (CMR) models are often used to analyze banding data. Common to this family of models are two assumptions: marks do not fall off or become unreadable and individuals within groups remain equally detectable. When data fail to meet these assumptions, results of CMR analyses may be biased. In studies of long-lived seabirds exposed to coarse nesting substrates, band wear is especially problematic. We compared surface wear from abrasion against rocks on incoloy and darvic bands applied to a long-lived seabird, the Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula arctica). In 2003 and 2004, surface wear on bands applied to chicks and adults was scored at five colonies in the Gulf of Maine. We used logistic regression to analyze two subsets of these data by fitting the probability of being worn (one or more characters difficult to read or obliterated) to band age, bird age, and band type. In both analyses, an evidence ratio provided exclusive support for the model that included all factors. Immature puffins largely avoid colonies and remain at sea until their second or third summer after hatching. Consequently, probabilities of being worn were delayed on both band types by 4 yr on bands applied to chicks compared to adults. Based on our estimates, 25% and 87% of darvic bands applied to chicks and adults, respectively, were worn after 5 yr. Wear was reduced by 71% and 87% annually on incoloy compared to darvic bands applied to adults and chicks, respectively. To uphold assumptions of CMR models, we recommend incoloy bands over darvic in studies spanning more than about 5 yr of long-lived seabirds exposed to coarse substrates. ©2006 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={We evaluated the influences of several ecological, biological, and methodological factors on post-fledging survival of a shortgrass prairie bird, the Lark Bunting (Calamospiza melanocorys). We estimated daily post-fledging survival (n = 206, 82 broods) using radiotelemetry and color bands to track fledglings. Daily survival probabilities were best explained by drought intensity, time in season (quadratic trend), ages ≤3 d post-fledging, and rank given drought intensity. Drought intensity had a strong negative effect on survival. Rank was an important predictor of fledgling survival only during the severe drought of 2002 when the smallest fledglings had lower survival. Recently fledged young (ages ≤3 d post-fledging) undergoing the transition from nest to surrounding habitat experienced markedly lower survival, demonstrating the vulnerable nature of this time period. Survival was greater in mid and late season than early season, corresponding to our assumptions of food availability. Neither mark type nor sex of attending parent influenced survival. The model-averaged product of the 22-d survival calculated using mean rank and median value of time in season was 0.360 ± 0.08 in 2001 and 0.276 ± 0.08 in 2002. Survival estimates that account for age, condition of young, ecological conditions, and other factors are important for parameterization of realistic population models. Biologists using population growth models to elucidate mechanisms of population declines should attempt to estimate species-specific of post-fledging survival rather than use generalized estimates. © 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Little is known about the period between fledging and breeding in long-lived birds, including survival rates and factors affecting survival, yet this period may be critical to population regulation. We conducted health exams on 72 nestling Wood Storks (Mycteria americana) aged 4-6 weeks, and monitored survival of these birds via satellite telemetry for up to two years of age. Eighty-two percent of nestlings fitted with transmitters in 2002 (n = 33) survived to fledging. Of these fledglings (n = 27), 44% survived their first year. Second-year survival for the same cohort (n = 12) was 75%. In contrast, 50% of nestlings fitted with transmitters in 2003 (n = 34) survived to fledging, and 6% of fledglings (n = 17) survived the first year. Of the health parameters we measured in large nestlings, white blood cell count was consistently the most closely related to postfledging survival. Significantly elevated heterophil:lymphocyte ratios in 2003 coincided with the observed high colony abandonment that year. After controlling for health parameters, gender also appeared to play a significant role in predicting survival, with males at greater risk of mortality. Hematological factors and gender were both more closely associated with survival in 2003 than in 2002, suggesting these factors may play a greater role in regulating postfledging survival or, in the case of hematology, serve as indicators of poor health in less favorable years when nestling storks are exposed to multiple stressors. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2006.},

For comparison, 66% of adult female Barrow's Goldeneyes captured in nest boxes and marked with leg bands in 2000-2002 were recaptured or seen again in subsequent years. We do not recommend the use of harnesses on diving ducks and sea ducks as it may affect their behavior and survival, at least for birds wintering in areas where conditions are severe.},

abstract={The striking black and white plumage of the juvenile Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) provides an excellent opportunity to examine the possible selective forces influencing the strategic placement of dark pigment in birds. The conflict between opposing selective pressures (first, toward large white patches, which may allay aggression in adults, and second, toward dark plumage to promote camouflage and limit solar and abrasive wear) provides the stage whereon are revealed a score of pigmentation traits of potential adaptive value. The general pigmentation trend is for zones that are more exposed to the sun to be darker than elsewhere. More specifically: (1) for rectrices and remiges, outer webs are darker than inner; (2) for those few feathers (e.g., central rectrices, some scapulars, and some tertials), where both inner and outer webs are heavily and nearly equally solar exposed, pigmentation is supplied similarly on both webs; (3) outermost primaries and rectrices are darkest of all and are structurally similar; (4) for central rectrices, subject to high levels of abrasion with substrate, the tip is paler (resultant flexibility may limit breakage); and (5) pigment is heavier along or on the rachis than on the webs. Many of the traits listed above for the Golden Eagle are also found in other families of birds. Traits of the tail common to many species were a terminal pale tip, a subterminal dark band, rachis darker than vane, and outer webs darker than inner for both remiges and rectrices. The most widespread traits likely have adaptive value. © 2006 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={While obligate siblicide is a phylogenetically widespread behavior, known from plants, insects, birds, and other taxa, with important implications for life history evolution, comprehensive evaluations of its costs and benefits to parents are rare. We used 12 years of breeding and band resight data to evaluate the importance of several potential benefits that marginal offspring (the usual victims of obligate siblicide) could provide to parent Nazca boobies (Sula granti), a seabird. We found no evidence for the resource-tracking hypothesis: 99.95% of two-chick broods were reduced to one chick before fledging, and the single exceptional brood probably lost one chick between fledging and independence. Behavioral observations indicated that siblicidal aggression caused most mortality of marginal chicks, and at least contributed to the remainder. We also found no evidence that marginal offspring provide a food resource for other family members. Marginal chicks benefit parents via adoption into other families, and possibly also in the context of progeny choice, but these benefits are minor compared to the insurance that marginal chicks provide against early failure of core (first-hatched) offspring. Further evaluation of the Insurance Egg Hypothesis showed that marginal and core offspring are functionally equivalent in the absence of sibling interactions, and that core offspring incur no detectable costs from behaving siblicidally. Nazca boobies are truly obligate brood reducers, with parents receiving principally insurance benefits from marginal offspring, but many birds and other taxa exhibiting persistent, unconditional sibling aggression do not exhibit universal brood reduction. Insurance is only one of several potential benefits that marginal offspring can confer on parents, and a multi-hypothesis approach to decompose the different types of benefits is required to understand the evolution of clutch size in other obligately siblicidal species. © Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract={Understanding the degree of demographic connectivity among population segments is increasingly recognized as central to the fields of population ecology and conservation biology. However, delineating discrete population units has proven challenging, particularly for migratory birds as they move through their annual cycle. In this study, radio telemetry was used to assess movement rates among habitats by harlequin ducks Histrionicus histrionicus during the non-breeding season in Prince William Sound, Alaska. A total of 434 females were outfitted with radio transmitters over six years of data collection, and their signals tracked by aircraft. Using a spatially nested design, it was determined that 75% of radioed females remained in the bay or coastline area where they were originally trapped, 94% remained on the same island or mainland region of Prince William Sound where they began the winter period, and 98% remained within the 4500 km2 study area as a whole. Home range analyses corroborated these findings, indicating that the scale of individual movements was small, with 95% kernel home range estimates averaging only 11.5±2.2 km2. A simple demographic model, which incorporated estimates for population size, survival, and movement rates, was used to infer the degree of independence among population segments. Immigrant females were found to contribute little to population numbers in most areas, accounting for only 4% of the adult female population at a scale of approximately 100 km2. These results have important implications for the scale of conservation action for the species and demonstrate that winter movements can have a strong influence local population dynamics. © Journal of Avian Biology.},

abstract={From 1999-2002, we attached satellite-received platform transmitter terminals (PTTs) to 40 adult female prairie falcons (Falco mexicanus) on their nesting grounds in the Snake River Birds of Prey National Conservation Area (NCA) in southwest Idaho. We used 3 variations of a backpack harness design that had been used previously on raptors. Each radiomarked falcon also received a color leg band with a unique alphanumeric code. We monitored survival of birds using radiotelemetry and searched for marked birds on their nesting grounds during breeding seasons after marking. Because 6 falcons removed their harnesses during the first year, we were able to compare survival rates of birds that shed PTTs with those that retained them. We describe a harness design that failed prematurely as well as designs that proved successful for long-term PTT attachment. We resighted 21 marked individuals on nesting areas 1-5 years after they were radiomarked and documented 13 mortalities of satellite-tracked falcons. We used a Cormack-Jolly-Seber model to estimate apparent survival probability based on band resighting and telemetry data. Platform transmitter terminals had no short-term effects on falcons or their nesting success during the nesting season they were marked, but birds that shed their transmitters increased their probability of survival. Estimated annual survival for birds that shed their transmitters was 87% compared to 49% for birds wearing transmitters. We discuss possible reasons for differences in apparent survival rates and offer recommendations for future marking of falcons.},

abstract={An important assumption of telemetry studies is that radiomarking does not negatively affect study animals. To test this assumption for mourning doves (Zenaida macroura), we evaluated whether subcutaneous transmitter implants (STI) would affect bird weight in cage studies and hunting mortality in field studies. At three weeks post-implantation, caged adult birds in the sham surgery and control groups gained and STI birds lost weight. Males gained and females lost weight. When percent weight change (PWC) for caged adult and juveniles were pooled the trends were similar, suggesting a STI treatment effect. In the field study, 16.3% of observed mortalities of STI birds during July-November 1998-2000 occurred during the first 3 days post-release. The overall 45-day summer period survival rate was relatively high, 0.9446 (95% CI = 0.8907-0.9986), when birds were entered into the population at-risk on the fourth day post-release. Although most observed mortalities were hunting-related (62.7%), similar direct recovery rates (P = 0.186) for STI (14.7%) and leg-banded birds (9.2%) suggests that implanted radios did not increase a bird's vulnerability to hunting mortality in the year of marking. However, the difference between the direct recovery rates of the 2 cohorts may be large enough to be biologically significant. Further research is needed to determine whether STI birds are especially susceptible to hunting mortality.},

abstract={Abdominally implanted radiotransmitters with percutaneous antennas are increasingly used to monitor movements, survival, and reproduction of waterbirds. However, there has been relatively little assessment of the effects of such radios on avian demographic parameters or migration. We implanted either a 26- or 35-g abdominal transmitter with percutaneous antenna in 198 adult female lesser Canada geese (Branta canadensis parvipes) in Anchorage, Alaska during 2000 and 2001. We compared migration chronology, reproductive effort, and survival of radiomarked females to 118 control females marked with leg bands. Arrival dates following spring migration were similar among females in different treatments in 2001. However, in 2002, wind direction during late migration was less favorable, and arrival of females with 35-g radiotransmitters lagged 1-2 days behind that of control females. Nest initiation dates, clutch size, and mean egg volume were similar for 152 nests of females that lacked radios and 62 nests of radiomarked females. Estimated nesting propensity for females with operable radiotransmitters was 61% and 72% in 2001 and 2002, respectively. Apparent annual survival (φ = 0.82, 95% confidence interval: 0.76 to 0.87) was similar among treatments in the first year after geese were marked. In the second and third years after marking, model-averaged estimates for survival of females with large radiotransmitters were 10% lower than estimates for control females. However, the effect of large radios on long-term survival was equivocal because of uncertainty surrounding treatment estimates. We conclude that abdominally implanted radiotransmitters with percutaneous antennas had small effects on migration chronology but no apparent effects on fecundity. Abdominal transmitters can provide unbiased estimates of anserine survival in the first year after deployment. Because of the potentially greater effects of larger transmitters on migration and long-term survival, we recommend that biologists minimize the size of implanted transmitters and deploy radios with caution if long-term survival of marked birds is a concern.},

abstract={The conservation of golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) requires a thorough understanding of their demographic parameters. Productivity, commonly measured as the number of nestlings or fledglings per pair, is the parameter reported by most studies of nesting golden eagles and is often used as a measure of their population status. Survival may be an equally or more important parameter to measure; however, survival rates of golden eagles are not well documented. We used satellite telemetry to estimate the probability of first-year survival for migratory golden eagles raised in Denali National Park and Preserve, Alaska, USA. We calculated the probability of first-year survival using program MARK. Based on the best approximating model, monthly survival probability was 0.88 ± 0.04 (mean ± SE) during the autumn migration and early winter period for golden eagles marked in 1997 and 0.78 ± 0.05 during the same period for golden eagles marked in 1999. Monthly survival during the remaining 3 periods (i.e., late winter, spring migration, summer) was 0.94 ± 0.03 for both cohorts. Survival during the entire 11-month period was 0.34 ± 0.10 for the 1997 cohort and 0.19 ± 0.07 for the 1999 cohort. Causes of mortality included starvation, electrocution, and poaching. Our results indicate that low first-year survival may limit recruitment and we recommend that golden eagle monitoring programs include survival estimates.},

abstract={We used satellite transmitters (platform transmitting terminals or PTTs) during 2002 and 2003 to document spring migration timing, routes, stopover sites, and nesting sites of adult female Northern Pintails (Anas acuta) from major wintering areas of the Gulf Coast (N = 20) and Playa Lakes Regions (PLR, N = 20) in Texas, and the Middle Rio Grande Valley, New Mexico (MRGV, N = 15). Some Pintails tagged in the MRGV continued movements into Mexico. Poor winter survival or PTT failure reduced sample size to 15 for PLR Pintails, 5 for Gulf Coast Pintails, and 11 for MRGV Pintails. Apparent winter survival was 66% lower for Texas Gulf Coast PTT-tagged Pintails than for those from the PLR and MRGV. Pintails from each area used different routes to their respective breeding grounds. PTT-tagged Pintails from the MRGV followed the Rio Grande Valley north to southern Colorado, before traveling on to the Dakotas and Canada or traveled northeast and joined the migration of PLR Pintails in Texas or Kansas. The latter made initial stops in Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado, or the Dakotas. Gulf Coast Pintails traveled through north-central Oklahoma or central Kansas. Pintails that had stopped first in Kansas or Nebraska tended to settle to nest in the United States. Wetland availability in the Prairie Pothole Region of the Northern Great Plains influenced nesting destinations of PTT-tagged Pintails, but individuals settled across a wide swath of northern North America. We did not detect any consistently-used spring staging areas. Therefore, negative impacts to any of the marked populations, or their wetland habitats, may have continental implications.},

abstract={Human development often favors species adapted to human conditions with subsequent negative effects on sensitive species. This is occurring throughout the urbanizing world as increases by generalist omnivores, like some crows and ravens (corvids) threaten other birds with increased rates of nest predation. The process of corvid responses and their actual effects on other species is only vaguely understood, so we quantified the population response of radio-tagged American crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), common ravens (Corvus corax), and Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri) to human settlements and campgrounds and examined their influence as nest predators on simulated marbled murrelet (Brachyramphus marmoratus) nests on Washington's Olympic Peninsula from 1995 to 2000. The behavior and demography of crows, ravens, and jays was correlated to varying degrees with proximity to human development. Crows and ravens had smaller home ranges and higher reproduction near human settlements and recreation. Annual survival of crows was positively associated with proximity to human development. Home range and reproduction of Steller's jays was independent of proximity to human settlements and campgrounds. Local density of crows increased because home ranges of neighboring breeding pairs overlapped extensively (6× more than ravens and 3× more than Steller's jays) and breeders far from anthropogenic foods traveled 10s of kilometers to access them. Corvids accounted for 32.5% of the predation events (n = 837) we documented on artificial murrelet nests. Small corvids (jays) were common nest predators across our study area but their contribution as predators did not vary with proximity to settlements and campgrounds. In contrast, large corvids (crows and ravens) were rare nest predators across our study area but their contribution varied greatly with proximity to settlements and campgrounds. Managers seeking to reduce the risk of nest predation need to consider the varied impacts and variable behavioral and population responses of potential nest predators. In our situation, removing large corvids may do little to reduce overall rates of nest predation because of the diverse predator assemblage, but reducing anthropogenic food in the landscape may be effective. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Few studies detail population-wide winter movements of Northern Goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) in North America or examine their winter ecology and habitat associations. Using satellite-telemetry transmitters, landscape-habitat models, aerial photos, and field sampling, we assessed movements and wintering habitats of goshawks breeding in Utah. In our study, 42 adult females were fitted with 30 g or 32 g platform transmitter terminals (PTT) between 2000 and 2003. Our data suggest that females in the populations studied were either migrants or semi-migrants that moved randomly throughout the state or residents. Resident birds remained in the general area around the breeding territory but used a wider variety of habitat cover types and commonly moved downward in elevation during winter. In contrast, birds that migrated or semi-migrated from their breeding territories for the winter generally used the pinyon-juniper habitat cover type. This pinyon-juniper habitat tended to be a mosaic of fairly open pinyon-juniper forest and sagebrush ecotones. The wintering areas for each bird were analyzed using vegetative sampling methods in order to determine correlations between habitat structure and goshawk use. Vegetative structure in the winter areas varied widely, but all goshawks used areas of forest-non-forest edge throughout the winter. Many of the selected winter sites showed signs of human manipulation (tree harvest, tree and brush removal by chaining, or fire). These findings increase our understanding of what constitutes goshawk wintering habitat and place new priority on understanding the use of various habitat cover types by wintering Northern Goshawks.},

abstract={We studied the survival and reproduction of a newly introduced population of Eastern Wild Turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) during 1999 and 2000 to determine the adaptability of this subspecies to a minimally wooded (<10%) region located north of their recorded historic distribution in South Dakota. During 1999 and 2000, the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks (SDGFP) released 111 female and 25 male turkeys from Iowa and Kentucky onto a study area in northeastern South Dakota. We used radio telemetry to monitor survival and reproduction of the females for 2 years after their initial release. Annual survival for 71 females averaged 67%. Seasonal survival was lowest in fall and highest in winter. Mortality agents included avian and mammalian predators, haying equipment, automobiles, and unknown causes. Nesting rate for the 2 years averaged 93%, and renesting rate of turkeys with failed 1st-nest attempts averaged 45%. Nest success for all nests was 50%, and 62% of females attempting to nest each year were successful in at least 1 attempt. Predation was the primary cause of nest failure during both years. Overall, 72% of brooding females successfully raised ≥1 poult to 4 weeks post-hatch while individual poult survival to 4 weeks post-hatch averaged 36%. Despite <10% woodland cover, Eastern Wild Turkeys appeared to thrive in a glacial escarpment topography north of their historic range in the northern plains.},

abstract={Patterns of habitat use by some passerines change after the young leave the nest, and thus our understanding of habitat selection derived from counts of singing males earlier in the nesting cycle may not adequately represent the breeding habitat requirements of these species. Post-fledging changes in habitat use may have important conservation implications if the survival of fledglings is affected by characteristics of the habitat; however, there have been relatively few systematic studies of the post-fledging ecology of forest passerines and, of these, even fewer have incorporated analyses of the relationship between habitat characteristics and fledgling survival. We studied the post-fledging habitat selection and survival of ovenbirds Seiurus aurocapilla in northern New Hampshire, USA during two breeding seasons using radio telemetry. Habitat at sites used by radio-marked fledgling ovenbirds was characterized by fewer large trees and greater vertical structure 0-3 m above ground than ovenbird nest sites. Similarly, habitat at sites used by fledgling ovenbirds was characterized by fewer large trees and greater vertical structure than unused sites. Most (80%) of the 15 mortalities that we observed were due to predation. Nine (70%) of these occurred within the first 3 days of fledging, resulting in a significant drop in survival during this period. Fledgling survival increased significantly with increased vegetation structure. Our observations that fledgling ovenbirds are selective in their habitat use, that they select different habitat features than adult ovenbirds select for nesting and that fledgling survival is positively associated with these habitat features suggest that the use of habitat models based on counts of singing males before fledging does not adequately represent the habitat needs of this species. Conceivably, mortality during the post-fledging period could limit recruitment to levels insufficient to maintain the viability of ovenbird population even if adequate nesting habitat were available.},

However, little is known about destinations and strategies of individual insects. We attached miniaturized radio transmitters (ca 300 mg) to the thoraxes of 14 individual dragonflies (common green darners, Anax junius) and followed them during their autumn migration for up to 12 days, using receiver-equipped Cessna airplanes and ground teams. Green darners exhibited distinct stopover and migration days. On average, they migrated every 2.9±0.3 days, and their average net advance was 58±11 km in 6.1±0.9 days (11.9±2.8 km d-1) in a generally southward direction (186±52°). They migrated exclusively during the daytime, when wind speeds were less than 25 kmh -1, regardless of wind direction, but only after two nights of successively lower temperatures (decrease of 2.1±0.6 °C in minimum temperature). The migratory patterns and apparent decision rules of green darners are strikingly similar to those proposed for songbirds, and may represent a general migration strategy for long-distance migration of organisms with high self-propelled flight speeds. © 2006 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Snakes are important predators of birds' nests, but the ecological factors that bring snakes and birds into contact are poorly known. One hypothesis is that snakes choose habitats based on abundance of alternative prey such as small mammals, with avian nest predation in those habitats arising coincidentally. At a study site in southern Illinois, we used radio telemetry to test the hypothesis that ratsnakes (Elaphe obsoleta) and racers (Coluber constrictor) preferentially use forest edges because small mammals are more abundant in edges. Diet analysis confirmed that both snake species preyed on birds and mammals. Although overall habitat use differed, both snake species preferentially used forest edges. Conversely, species of small mammals on which the snakes preyed were not more abundant (determined by live trapping) in edges, and seasonal variation in habitat use by snakes and mammalian prey abundance were not correlated. These results suggest that alternative hypotheses (e.g., abundance of nesting birds, thermoregulation) are more promising explanations for why these snakes preferentially use edges.},

abstract={Radiotelemetry has provided wildlife biologists with a tool to estimate survival where fates of individuals likely are known. Analyses of known-fate data can yield accurate survival estimates if 5 assumptions are met. Two of these assumptions are rarely tested: that transmitters have no effect on survival of study animals and that right-censoring (i.e., any animal not located is as likely to be alive as dead) is random with respect to the survival of study animals. Using joint-models originally developed for live-encounter and dead-recovery data, we examined the potential for bias in survival estimates of radiomarked male lesser prairie-chickens (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) in a 3-year study in southwestern Kansas, USA. Additionally, we examined the potential bias of right-censoring by comparing the return rates of known-fate and right-censored individuals. We captured 216 male lesser prairie-chickens and marked them with a combination of leg bands and a radio (n = 72) or leg bands only (n = 144). We applied joint-models to capture histories based on live-capture and telemetry data. The model best supported by the data indicated that 6-month survival was constant (Ŝc = 0.679, SE = 0.050) across radiomarked and banded birds. Eight of 16 (50%, SE = 12.5%) right-censored birds not detected because of radio failure were subsequently recaptured, which was not different from the return rates for known-fate birds (23 of 59; 39%, SE = 6.3%). Survival estimates of male lesser prairie-chickens in this study were not measurably biased by radiomarking, as their survival was greater than or equal to those of banded birds, and right-censored birds had similar return rates to those of known-fate individuals. Our results are encouraging because they indicate that 2 critical assumptions underlying analyses of known-fate data can be met with radiotransmitters and attachment techniques currently used in field studies of wild populations of lesser prairie-chickens.},

abstract={The breeding stock composition and ecology of Canada (Branta canadensis) and cackling (B. hutchinsii) geese, collectively white-cheeked geese, staging in interior Alaska and wintering in the Pacific Northwest is poorly understood. We captured, measured, and applied neck collars to white-cheeked geese during spring and fall staging near Fairbanks and Delta Junction, Alaska, USA, to study their breeding stock composition, migration, and winter distribution. We measured exposed culmen, flattened wing chord, total tarsus, and body length of geese staging in interior Alaska to assist with determination of breeding stock. The first principal components, as well as a univariate measurement of exposed culmen, indicated geese trapped in Fairbanks in the fall were larger on average than geese trapped in Delta Junction in either spring or fall. We observed or recovered most of the banded geese detected in fall and winter in central British Columbia, Canada, central Washington, USA, and north-central Oregon, USA, east of the Cascade Mountains, with relatively few observations in western British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon. We found no evidence of movement between wintering areas on the east and west sides of the Cascade Mountains. Geese that we trapped during spring staging in Delta Junction were more often observed on the west side of the Cascade Mountains than geese trapped during fall staging in Fairbanks. Most (93%) geese trapped during fall staging in both Fairbanks and Delta Junction, however, wintered east of the Cascade Mountains. After-hatch-year (AHY) geese from interior Alaska staging areas observed on the west side of the Cascade Mountains were structurally smaller on average than AHY geese observed on the east side of the Cascade Mountains. Our results indicate fall staging white-cheeked geese in Fairbanks were predominantly 1 breeding stock of white-cheeked geese, while fall and spring staging white-cheeked geese in Delta Junction comprised at least 2 stocks of white-cheeked geese. Based on our findings, we recommend separate harvest and management strategies be considered for small white-cheeked geese migrating through coastal and central British Columbia and wintering east and west of the Cascade Mountains in Washington and Oregon to avoid potential overharvest of independent breeding stocks.},

abstract={The Broad-winged Hawk (Buteo platypterus brunnescens) is an endemic, non-migratory subspecies of the highly migratory nominate form. Broad-winged Hawks inhabit the interior montane forests of Puerto Rico and are listed as endangered. We studied the Broad-winged Hawk in Rio Abajo Forest and surrounding lands during 2001 and 2002. Adult and juvenile Broad-winged Hawks were trapped using a modified bal-chatri trap and a dho-gaza net. Nestlings were taken by hand from the nest. We collected morphometric measurements and radio-tagged eight Broad-winged Hawks. We obtained 884 locations from radio-tagged hawks and mapped territories of unmarked Broad-winged Hawk breeding pairs by direct observation from limestone hilltops. Telemetry locations per hawk averaged 105 (10-277) overall, with an average of 3.5 locations per bird per week. Transmitter life ranged from 31 to 464 days and averaged 218 days. Adult annual home range (95% kernel) averaged 213.1 ha, and ranged from 62.9-446.1 ha. Juvenile annual home range averaged 130.7 ha, and ranged from 48.2-250.9 ha. We recorded Broad-winged Hawks perched in 16 different tree species at an average height of 10.4 m. Tree species most frequently used as perches were Hibiscus elatus and Tectona grandis. Analysis indicated disproportional use of habitat by Broad-winged Hawks (P < 0.001). In our study area radio-tagged Broad-winged Hawks selected four of six available habitat associations. These included seasonal evergreen forest, montane forest, montane evergreen shrub, and regenerating forest. We identified three areas of high Broad-winged Hawk use in the periphery of Rio Abajo Forest that should be considered for protection or acquisition. We documented reduced dispersal by Broad-winged Hawk juveniles and suggest this is an adaptive response to insular conditions. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Survival estimation is an important aspect of population ecology and conservation biology, and radiotelemetry is a major tool for assessing factors influencing survival time in free-ranging birds and mammals. Despite the advantage of telemetry in providing extensive and continuous survival information, telemetry-based survival estimates can be biased or imprecise when methods are misused. Simple cumulative survival estimators like the Heisey and Fuller and Kaplan-Meier methods have underlying assumptions and sampling requirements that commonly remain unverified by researchers. Telemetry studies often limit survival analysis to simple univariate tests that do not consider the range of factors potentially influencing mortality risk in free-ranging animals. Continuous-time modeling approaches like Cox Proportional Hazards or Anderson-Gill methods, or their discrete-time analogues, are superior because they are robust to a range of study design limitations and can handle multiple categorical or continuous covariates including those that vary with time or subject age. Parametric models may be difficult to fit in telemetry studies because the appropriate hazard function in wildlife populations usually is not known. The main assumptions in survival study design are that 1) subjects represent the population of interest, 2) mortality risk is independent between subjects, and 3) subjects are lost to follow-up (i.e., censored) randomly. These assumptions are prone to violation in telemetry research, and their assessment and possible remediation should be prioritized. Telemetry studies often are characterized by small sample size or short duration; both attributes lead to low numbers of mortalities and thus lack of precision in the survival estimate. I conclude that telemetry-based survival estimation will benefit from increased emphasis on modeling approaches designed to elucidate survival determinants in complex systems, combined with more rigorous attention to basic assumptions and study design limitations.},

Despite the suggestion that extra-pair copulations could be taking place away from nest sites, very little is known about movement patterns of individual Tree Swallows during the pre-laying and laying periods. We used radio telemetry to track movement patterns of four female Tree Swallows at dawn and dusk during the pre-laying and laying periods. Our tracking results indicate that individual females differed in their movement patterns: some remained close to their nest site on multiple nights while others were rarely detected near their nest box at night. Despite differences in movement patterns, all four females that we tracked produced extra-pair offspring for which we were unable to identify extra-pair sires, even after sampling the majority of males breeding within our nest-box grids. Despite the small sample size, our results confirmed extensive Tree Swallow movement away from nest-box grids during the pre-laying and laying periods. This highlights the need for future studies of mating behavior away from the nesting site, particularly for species that forage and/or roost in communal areas during their fertile period.},

abstract={Recordings of avian vocal signals in natural habitats include ambient noise. Often this background noise corrupts across all frequencies and is of substantial amplitude. Reducing this ambient noise to prepare vocal signals for playback stimuli or to remove habitat-specific noise signatures prior to analyzing a signal's acoustic characteristics can be useful. We conducted experimental evaluations of three noise reduction procedures to determine their effectiveness. We embedded two bird vocalizations ("clean" signals) in four kinds of natural noise, resulting in eight noise-signal combinations. We then applied three noise reduction procedures (Noise Profile, Band Pass, and Noise Estimate) to each of the embedded signals and compared the recovered signals to the original (clean) signals. Noise Profile filtering was effective in reducing noise and returning fairly high-quality signals from even severe levels of masking noise. The other two noise reduction procedures did not perform as well. For the two most corrupting maskers, however, Noise Profile filtering also altered the signal properties by reducing signal amplitude at those frequencies containing high levels of noise. Apart from this loss of amplitude, the quantitative features of the filtered signals were similar to those of the original model sounds. We conclude that Noise Profile filtering produces good results for cases where noise is approximately constant over the signal duration and the signal intensity exceeds noise intensity over the frequencies of interest. ©2007 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Although radiotelemetry is useful for monitoring nest attendance and the foraging ranges and distribution of breeding birds, attachment of transmitters may affect reproductive behavior. In 2003, we captured 25 adult Tufted Puffins (Fratercula cirrhata) at two colonies in Chiniak Bay, Kodiak Island, Alaska, and fitted them with subcutaneously anchored radiotransmitters (<1.2% of body mass). We determined the presence of radio-marked birds at each study site using automated, remote radiotelemetry systems, and compared rates of nestling growth, fledging mass, and fledging success for chicks with and without (control group) a radio-marked parent. Although most radio-marked adults continued to attend nests after capture and attachment of transmitters, nestlings with a radio-marked parent had lower mean growth rates (6.9 g/d vs. 14.4 g/d) and fledging success (33% vs. 84%) than control chicks. These results suggest that colony attendance by adult puffins fitted with transmitters declined sharply or completely and this led to high nestling mortality. Given the negative effects of transmitters on Tufted Puffins in our study and in other studies of alcids, we suggest delaying the attachment of transmitters until well after the brooding period. In addition, we recommend pilot studies be undertaken to distinguish the possible effects of capture and handling from those of actually carrying the device. ©2007 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={We investigated territoriality, prospecting, and dispersal behavior in cooperatively breeding Pohnpei Micronesian Kingfishers (Todiramphus cinnamominus reichenbachii) throughout the annual cycle using radiotelemetry and color-band resights. Mean home-range size was 6.3 ha and territories were 8.1 ha. Within territories, Micronesian Kingfishers shared 63% of their home-range space with coterritorial occupants, and 3% was shared with extraterritorial conspecifics. Birds on cooperative territories had larger home ranges that overlapped more with coterritory occupants' home ranges than birds in pair-held territories. Despite evidence suggesting that resources necessary for survival and reproduction occurred on each territory, Micronesian Kingfishers of all age and sex classes made extraterritorial prospecting movements. Prospecting was rare; it comprised only 4.3% of our observations. When birds departed on forays, they were gone for ∼1.9 h and returned to home territories before sunset. Prospecting by dominant birds was temporally correlated with courtship and nest initiation, and birds were observed at neighboring nest sites with opposite-sex conspecifics during the period when females were available for fertilization. Juveniles and helpers prospected throughout the year and made repeated homesteading movements to dispersal destinations before dispersing. Mean dispersal distance for radiomarked individuals was 849 m. Results suggest that prospecting in Micronesian Kingfishers is a complex behavior that provides information for dispersal decisions and familiarity with dispersal destinations. Additionally, extraterritorial movements may provide covert opportunities for reproduction, which have potential to profoundly influence the distribution of fitness among helper and dominant Micronesian Kingfishers. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2007.},

abstract={Estimates of population trend for the interior subspecies of band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata fasciata) are not available because no standardized survey method exists for monitoring the interior subspecies. We evaluated 2 potential band-tailed pigeon survey methods (auditory and call-broadcast surveys) from 2002 to 2004 in 5 mountain ranges in southern Arizona, USA, and in mixed-conifer forest throughout the state. Both auditory and call-broadcast surveys produced low numbers of cooing pigeons detected per survey route (x̄ ≤ 0.67) and had relatively high temporal variance in average number of cooing pigeons detected during replicate surveys (CV ≥ 161%). However, compared to auditory surveys, use of call-broadcast increased 1) the percentage of replicate surveys on which ≥1 cooing pigeon was detected by an average of 16%, and 2) the number of cooing pigeons detected per survey route by an average of 29%, with this difference being greatest during the first 45 minutes of the morning survey period. Moreover, probability of detecting a cooing pigeon was 27% greater during call-broadcast (0.80) versus auditory (0.63) surveys. We found that cooing pigeons were most common in mixed-conifer forest in southern Arizona and density of male pigeons in mixed-conifer forest throughout the state averaged 0.004 (SE = 0.001) pigeons/ha. Our results are the first to show that call-broadcast increases the probability of detecting band-tailed pigeons (or any species of Columbidae) during surveys. Call-broadcast surveys may provide a useful method for monitoring populations of the interior subspecies of band-tailed pigeon in areas where other survey methods are inappropriate.},

abstract={Waved albatrosses (Phoebastria irrorata Salvin, 1883) forage close to their breeding grounds on Isla Española, Galápagos, during the short chick-brooding stage and make long trips to the Peruvian upwelling during incubation and chick rearing. Previous studies have suggested foraging segregation by sex: females spend more time searching than males do while foraging in the Galapagos Marine Reserve (GMR), and band recoveries suggest higher bycatch vulnerability of males in the Peruvian upwelling. We used stable isotope analysis (δ15N and δ13C) of whole blood of adult male and female albatrosses to test for intraspecific foraging segregation in this sexually dimorphic species. Analysis of serial blood samples revealed higher δ15N values in males, suggesting consumption of prey items of higher trophic level. We also detected seasonal variation in foraging ecology, with higher δ15N values at the beginning of the breeding season. Sex and regional differences in δ13C values were not significant, reflecting primarily pelagic foraging sites of both sexes, both in the GMR and the Peruvian upwelling. Our results provide evidence of trophic segregation, suggestive of competitive exclusion, and novel information on marine isoscape values in the Eastern Equatorial Pacific. © 2007 NRC.},

abstract={Studies using stable-isotope analyses of feathers to determine molt locations in marine birds are increasingly common but generally lack verification through ground-truthing. In this study, we examined the stable isotope compositions of wing feathers from King Eiders (Somateria spectabilis) implanted with satellite-transmitters. We compared stable carbon, nitrogen, and hydrogen isotope compositions (δ13C, δ15N, and δD, respectively) of primary feathers with the geographic location of wing molt in the subsequent year. Longitude of molt locations of eiders was highly correlated with δ13C (r2 = 0.69, N = 12) and δD (r2 = 0.90, N = 12) isotope values from their primary feathers grown in the previous year. There was no relationship between δ15N and location of wing molt (r2 = 0.007, N = 12). The results of this study provide further evidence for site fidelity during wing molt by King Eiders.},

abstract={Understanding the persistence mechanisms of tropical forest species in human-dominated landscapes is a fundamental challenge of tropical ecology and conservation. Many species, including more than half of Costa Rica's native land birds, use mostly deforested agricultural countryside, but how they do so is poorly known. Do they commute regularly to forest or can some species survive in this human-dominated landscape year-round? Using radiotelemetry, we detailed the habitat use, movement, foraging, and nesting patterns of three bird species, Catharus aurantiirostris, Tangara icterocephala, and Turdus assimilis, by obtaining 8101 locations from 156 individuals. We chose forest birds that varied in their vulnerability to deforestation and were representative of the species found both in forest and human-dominated landscapes. Our study species did not commute from extensive forest; rather, they fed and bred in the agricultural countryside. Nevertheless, T. icterocephala and T. assimilis, which are more habitat sensitive, were highly dependent on the remaining trees. Although trees constituted only 11% of land cover, these birds spent 69% to 85% of their time in them. Breeding success of C. aurntiirostris and T. icterocephala in deforested habitats was not different than in forest remnants, where T. assimilis experienced reduced breeding success. Although this suggests an ecological trap for T. assimilis, higher fledgling survival in forest remnants may make up for lower productivity. Tropical countryside has high potential conservation value, which can be enhanced with even modest increases in tree cover. Our findings have applicability to many human-dominated tropical areas that have the potential to conserve substantial biodiversity if appropriate restoration measures are taken. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

We analyzed all direct recoveries of woodcock banded in Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, USA, as well as wing-collection survey data, to determine the progression of fall migration, the migration direction, and the final destination of woodcock migrating from these states. We did not observe migration initiation based on band recoveries until late October and early November, with most migration occurring during November. Wing-receipt data showed a similar trend, with most change in mean receipt latitude occurring from 1 November to 5 December. During November, wing receipts were spread through the entire Central Region. By 15-31 December, 92% (n = 26) of band recoveries were on the wintering grounds (south of latitude 33°N). Most banded woodcock from Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin wintered in Louisiana, USA. Woodcock banded in these states will be exposed to harvest for most of the hunting season because they remain in these states through November. If the population status of local birds is a concern, managers should consider this migration pattern when setting season dates.},

abstract={Reduced chick survival has been implicated in declines of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations. Because monitoring survival of unmarked sage-grouse chicks is difficult, radiotelemetry may be an effective technique to estimate survival rates, identify causes of mortality, and collect ecological data. Previous studies have used subcutaneous implants to attach radiotransmitters to hatchlings of several species of birds with precocial young. Previous researchers who used subcutaneous implants in free-ranging populations removed chicks from the capture location and implanted transmitters at an alternate site. Because logistics precluded removing newly hatched greater sagegrouse chicks from the field, we evaluated a method for implanting transmitters at capture locations. We captured 288 chicks from 52 broods and monitored 286 radiomarked chicks daily for 28 days following capture during May and June 2001-2002. Two (<1%) chicks died during surgery and we did not radiomark them. At the end of the monitoring period, 26 chicks were alive and 212 were dead. Most (98%, 207/212) radiomarked chick mortality occurred ≤21 days posthatch and predation (82%, 174/212) was the primary cause of death. Necropsies of 22 radiomarked chicks did not indicate inflammation or infection from implants, and they were not implicated in the death of any chicks. Fate of 48 chicks was unknown because of transmitter loss (n = 16), radio failure (n = 29), and brood mixing (n = 3). Overall, the 28-day chick survival rate was 0.220 (SE = 0.028). We found that mortalities related to the implant procedure and transmitter loss were similar to rates reported by previous researchers who removed chicks from capture sites and implanted transmitters at an alternate location. Subcutaneous implants may be a useful method for attaching transmitters to newly hatched sage-grouse chicks to estimate survival rates, identify causes of mortality, and collect ecological data.},

abstract={Long-term population declines and habitat reductions have increased concern over the status of the lesser prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus). Robust estimates of demographic parameters are essential for identifying population declines and planning effective management. We evaluated the effects of age and season on the survival of female lesser prairie-chickens at 2 sites in southwestern Kansas, USA. Using telemetry data from a 7-year field study (from 1997 to 2003), we estimated seasonal (Apr-Sep) and annual (Apr-Mar) survival. We also examined daily survival rates of females attending nests during the 26-day incubation period and young during the 14-day early brood-rearing period. We evaluated the probable mortality causes of radiomarked birds by examining evidence at recovery sites. We captured 227 female lesser prairie-chickens (87 yearlings, 117 ad, and 23 age undetermined) and fitted them with radiotransmitters. Estimates of 12-month survival were lower among yearlings (Ŝ12 = 0.429, SE = 0.117) and adults at site I (Ŝ12 = 0.302, SE = 0.080) than among yearlings (Ŝ12 = 0.588, SE = 0.100) and adults at site II (Ŝ12 = 0.438, SE = 0.083). The patterns in timing of mortality and age-specific 6-month survival were consistent with those of 12-month estimates at site I from 1998 to 2002, with a peak in mortality during May and June. Females tending to nests or to prefledged chicks had lower daily survival (DŜRtend = 0.993, SE = 0.001) than females not involved in these activities (DŜRfailedbreeder = 0.997, SE = 0.002). We recorded 92 mortalities from April 1997 to March 2003, and 59% and 11% were attributed to predation by mammals and raptors, respectively. Our research suggests that predation during the nesting season can have a major impact on lesser prairie-chicken demography, and conservation efforts should focus on enhancing female survival during the nesting and brood-rearing seasons.},

Therefore, careful study design including consideration of sample size is important, We used simulations to examine how sample size, population size, and population variance affected probability of making reliable inferences from a sample and the precision of estimates of population parameters. For populations of > 100 individuals, a sample >20 birds was needed to make reliable inferences about questions with simple outcomes (i.e., 2 possible outcomes). Sample size demands increased rapidly for more complex problems. For example, in a problem with 3 outcomes, a sample of >75 individuals will be needed for proper inference to the population. Combining data from satellite telemetry studies with data from surveys or other types of sampling may improve inference strength.},

abstract={Measurement of stable-hydrogen isotopes (δD) in feathers of migrating birds can provide information on where feathers were grown in North America, at least to an approximate band of latitude. This approach has greatly increased our ability to investigate aspects of avian migration and stopover ecology, since origins of unmarked individuals at migration stopover sites can be estimated for the first time. However, few studies have explored the power of combining isotope measurements with geographic information system (GIS) methods. We measured δD values in feathers of hatching-year (HY) Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus; n = 60), Wood Thrushes (Hylocichla mustelina; n = 113), and Gray Catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis; n = 158) at Ft. Morgan Peninsula, Alabama (30°10'N, 88°00'W), a migration stopover site along the Gulf coast. By applying an elevation-corrected hydrogen isotope basemap for birds in North America, we derived a GIS surface depicting expected feather δD values across the continent. We then used GIS to constrain the possible origins of the sampled populations by considering only values falling within the North American breeding ranges of the species. We depicted likely origins of migrating birds by the 50% and 75% tolerance limits of the data. Our GIS analysis indicated that our captured populations represented much-reduced regions of possible origin based on the North American breeding distributions. Gradients in abundance data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) allowed us to further narrow possible origins within isotopic boundaries for Wood Thrushes and Gray Catbirds. This exercise provided a means by which priority regions and habitats could be assessed at large continental scales based on actual productivity. We suggest the combination of isotopic and GIS tools provides a powerful means to derive conservation priorities and to investigate key factors involved in the ecology of avian migration and stopover. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2007.},

abstract={Two challenges in wildlife telemetry are optimizing the duration of transmitter attachment and minimizing the impacts of radios on the behavior and demography of the study animal. We tested 4 methods of radio attachment for a breeding population of upland sandpipers (Bartramia longicauda) under natural conditions at a tallgrass prairie site in Kansas, USA. To estimate radio retention and weekly survival rates, we used the nest survival model of Program MARK. Radio retention was lowest at the start and the end of the breeding period. The expected duration of radio retention was 1.8 years for a leg-loop harness, 40 days for radios glued to clipped feathers, 26 days for radios glued directly to feathers, and 7 days for radios glued to bare skin. Few radiomarked birds died during our study, but 4 of 8 mortality events were discovered within one week of radiomarking. Both glue and harnesses increased predation risk immediately after radio attachment. The weekly probability of survival was high after a 1-week acclimation period, and the expected survival for a 10-week breeding period was similar in males and females. Attachment of radios with glue had no effect on annual return rates. However, attachment of radios with leg harnesses resulted in lower return rates among radiomarked birds than birds without radios. Radios attached with glue were shed in <1 year but radios attached with harnesses were retained for up to 1-2 years. Our results indicate a tradeoff between optimizing radio retention and minimizing impacts on demography. Glue techniques had retention rates that were suitable for only short-term studies, but attachment with glue had no long-term effect on annual return rates. Leg harnesses provided effective radio retention that had little effect on survival rates during the stationary breeding period, but resulted in lower annual return rates. Robust estimates of radio retention and survival will assist researchers in selecting attachment techniques that best meet the study goals of future telemetry projects.},

abstract={Migratory behavior can be an important factor in determining contaminant exposure in avian populations. Accumulation of organochlorine (OC) pesticides while birds are wintering in tropical regions has been cited often as the reason for high concentrations in migrant populations. To explore this issue, we satellite tracked 16 Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) over the period 1996-2003 from breeding sites in British Columbia, Canada, and integrated the results into a database on 15 Ospreys that were satellite tracked over the period 1995-1999, from breeding locations in Washington and Oregon, USA. Data on wintering sites of 31 Ospreys in Mexico and Central America were used for spatially targeted sampling of prey fish. Concentrations of the main organochlorine contaminant, p,p′-dichloro-diphenyl-dichloroethylene (DDE), in fish composites from Mexico ranged from 0.005 to 0.115 μg/g wet mass. Significant differences existed among fish families in p,p′-DDE, total dichloro- diphenyltrichloroethane (ΣDDT), Σchlordanes, and total polychlorinated biphenyls (ΣPCBs). Catfish (family Ariidae) generally had significantly higher levels of DDT metabolites and other organochlorine contaminants compared to other fish families collected. Differences in prey contaminant levels were detected among the collection sites around coastal Mexico, with fish from Veracruz State generally having higher levels of DDT metabolites, Σchlordanes, ΣPCBs, and hexachlorobenzene. Eggs collected from 16 nests throughout the Pacific Northwest (nine from British Columbia, seven from Oregon and Washington) where Ospreys had been satellite tagged, showed marked variation in levels of DDT metabolites (p,p′-DDE; range 0.02-10.14 μg/g).

abstract={Little is known about the migration ecology of the American woodcock (Scolopax minor). From 2001 to 2003, we began a 3-year study to document woodcock fall migration routes, rates, and habitat use from Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, USA. Some 586 radiomarked woodcock initiated migration. During 224 hours of aerial telemetry, we located 42 radiomarked woodcock in 6 states. Using locations of radiomarked birds, we speculated woodcock migration routes in the central United States. Stopover duration often exceeded 4 days, with some birds stopping longer than a week. Radiomarked birds were located in upland habitats more frequently than bottomland habitats, and used a higher proportion of mature forest than expected. A Geographic Information System was used to map potential woodcock habitat in the Central Region. Based on our results, we identified possible fall migration routes and priority areas for woodcock management in the Central Region. Our results should be used by land managers to prioritize future land acquisition and management of woodcock habitat.},

A total of 24,464 acceptable detections was obtained for adult cormorants actively attempting to nest on the lake. Tagged cormorants had a bimodal dally activity pattern during the first month, with the fewest birds detected on the island at 09.00 h and 15.00 h Eastern daylight time. The pattern of activity appeared to change slightly in the second month of the study, representative of a post-breeding period for the colony, with a shift from a less synchronous pattern of departures to a greater focus on morning activity also centered around 09.30 h. These results correspond with daily observations of Great Cormorant (P. carbo) foraging activities reported for colonies in Africa and Poland. The data also support the possibility of nocturnal foraging activity, not previously reported for this species on their summer breeding grounds. No correlation was found between total number of daily detections and climatalogical factors or events.},

abstract={Numerous studies of behavior and ecology of northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) have depended on radiotagging and telemetry for data collection. Excluding the presumably short-term effects of trapping, handling, and attaching radiotransmitters, researchers often assume that little bias is associated with estimating survival and behavioral parameters associated with this technique. However, researchers have not adequately examined these effects on organisms being investigated and have thus assumed demographic information obtained from such methods are valid. In light of this conjecture, it is imperative to evaluate methodological assumptions to ensure research is statistically valid and biologically meaningful. Therefore, we used Burnham's model and program MARK to analyze survival estimates of individually banded and radiotagged bobwhites during an 8-year period (1997-2004) consisting of 6,568 individuals (2,527 radiotagged) via combined analysis of mark-recapture, dead recovery (via harvest), and radiotelemetry data to test the effects of radiotransmitters on bobwhite survival. We also compared band-recapture survival estimates to Kaplan-Meier survival estimates, and we examined the effects of various other factors (e.g., temporal, spatial) on bobwhite survival. Based on Akaike's model selection criterion, the best model including the radiotransmitter covariate (Akaike's Information Criterion adjusted for small sample size bias and overdispersion relative value = 0.72) did not explain more of the variation in survival than models without this effect. Thus, we found the effect of radiotransmitters as negligible. Bobwhite survival varied relative to spatial (e.g., site), temporal (e.g., yr and season), and gender effects. Average annual survival for the 8-year period was 22.76% (1.50 SE) for banded-only and 21.72% (1.49 SE) for radiotagged birds. Survival rate varied annually, ranging from 12.42% (7.51 SE) to 37.16% (8.27 SE), and seasonally, ranging from 23.82% (2.71 SE) to 65.06% (3.23 SE); however, between group (banded-only, radiotagged) survival differences were still inconsequential. We conclude that for our study, radiotelemetry provided reliable survival estimates of an intensively managed bobwhite population, where supplemental food was provided, and this information provided useful data to make practical habitat management decisions. We believe that future radiotelemetry studies would benefit as a whole if researchers conducted similar analyses prior to presenting their results from radiotelemetry data, especially for populations that are more food Limited.},

abstract={We used satellite-tracked transmitters in 2001 and 2003 to document the timing, location, and extent of molt migrations by female Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) affiliated with the Atlantic Flyway Resident Population (AFRP) of Canada Geese that breed in the temperate region of eastern North America. Twenty-seven adult females were captured during the nesting period in late May and fitted with a satellite transmitter mounted either on a plastic neck collar or backpack harness. Nests of 24 birds were destroyed late in incubation to prevent renesting and ensure nest failure; three females did not have nests. Twelve of the 27 birds (44%) made a northward migration to molt in northern Quebec, Canada: seven to the eastern coast of Hudson Bay (58°12'N, 76°60'W), three to lowland areas east of James Bay (53°30'N, 79°02'W), and two to interior locations south of Ungava Bay (55°54'N, 68°24'W). Molt migrants were present in northern Quebec from June to September, a period that coincides with breeding ground aerial surveys and banding operations conducted for Atlantic Population (AP) Canada Geese that breed in this same region of northern Quebec. With >1 million AFRP geese estimated in the Atlantic Flyway, the potential exists for substantial numbers of yearling, sub-adult, and nest-failed or non-breeding adults to molt migrate to northern breeding areas and bias efforts to survey and mark AP geese. Within AFRP breeding areas, many local flocks have reached nuisance levels. We hypothesized that by inducing molt migration in breeding adults, through destruction of nests late in incubation, we would lessen recruitment, reduce numbers of summer resident adults with young, and increase adult mortality from hunting. However, molt migration behavior was not uniform throughout our study area. Molt migrants were from rural areas in New York, Pennsylvania, and Vermont, whereas marked birds that did not make molt migrations were from more coastal regions of the flyway. The 14 birds that did not make a molt migration remained within 60 km of their banding site. A genetic comparison of these two groups revealed no detectable differences. We conclude that failure to undergo a molt migration is likely attributed to the historical origin of captive-reared birds of mixed subspecies that comprise AFRP flocks in the eastern regions of the flyway and the availability of quality local habitat, distinct from brood-rearing areas, for molting.},

abstract={1. The marbled murrelet Brachyramphus marmoratus is a threatened Alcid nesting in old-growth coastal forests from central California to Alaska. Logging has greatly reduced the amount and altered the pattern of the species' nesting habitat. Landscape fragmentation effects on the breeding ecology of the species are poorly understood because of the inaccessibility of nest sites. 2. Using radio-telemetry, 157 marbled murrelet nests were located in two old-growth areas in British Columbia, Canada, with different logging histories. Probable breeding success was estimated from nest attendance patterns by radio-tagged parents. Information-theoretic and hypothesis-testing methods were used to model breeding distribution (used vs. random unknown sites) and success (successful vs. failed nests) within c. 50-km radius extents at a scale of 2.3-km radius landscapes. Intersite transferability of distribution models was tested. 3. Breeding distribution was positively related with old-growth patch proximity, edge density (natural and artificial) and contrast, proportion of landscape under old-growth or core habitat, and interspersion of old-growth patches; it was negatively related with coastal zone proximity and mean old-growth patch size. Breeding success was negatively affected by the edge contrast, coast proximity and proportion of young forest, probably reflecting the distribution of nest predators. 4. All distribution models discriminated well between used and random landscapes within the training area. Intersite model transferability was good for 50% of the models. The models less predictive of the training site (area under the curve 0.676-0.738) were more transferable, probably because at the training site, which had considerably less old-growth nesting habitat (18% of extent) than the testing site (55%), breeding distribution was driven by a different subset of predictors. 5. Synthesis and applications. Geographic information system (GIS) data were helpful in discriminating between landscapes known to be used by nesting marbled murrelets and those with unknown breeding status. Previous indirect inferences about landscape-level effects on breeding distribution in the birds were shown to correspond with their true nesting distribution. Our results suggest that habitat fragmentation per se need not have a negative effect on the birds beyond that as a result of habitat loss, unless associated with an increased abundance of predators. Our results fine-tune the existing habitat conservation guidelines by suggesting that protection of old-growth forest adjacent to clearcuts is important. We provide a means for desktop classification of marbled murrelet landscapes. We advise the application of several different models, depending on the amount of remaining old-growth forest, to evaluate the consistency of predictions. © 2007 The Authors.},

abstract={Foraging habitat selection of nesting Great Egrets (Ardea alba) and Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) was investigated within an estuary with extensive impounded salt marsh habitat. Using a geographic information system, available habitat was partitioned into concentric bands at five, ten, and 15 km radius from nesting colonies to assess the relative effects of habitat composition and distance on habitat selection. Snowy Egrets were more likely than Great Egrets to depart colonies and travel to foraging sites in groups, but both species usually arrived at sites that were occupied by other wading birds. Mean flight distances were 6.2 km (SE = 0.4, N = 28, range 1.8-10.7 km) for Great Egrets and 4.7 km (SE = 0.48, N = 31, range 0.7-12.5 km) for Snowy Egrets. At the broadest spatial scale both species used impounded (mostly salt marsh) and estuarine edge habitat more than expected based on availability while avoiding unimpounded (mostly fresh water wetland) habitat. At more local scales habitat use matched availability. Interpretation of habitat preference differed with the types of habitat that were included and the maximum distance that habitat was considered available. These results illustrate that caution is needed when interpreting the results of habitat preference studies when individuals are constrained in their choice of habitats, such as for central place foragers.},

abstract={Status signals are traits that advertise an individual's competitive abilities to conspecifics during aggressive disputes. Most studies of status signals in birds have focussed on melanin-based plumage signals, but recent research shows that carotenoid-based signals may also play a role in aggressive signaling. We assessed the relative importance of melanin- and carotenoid-based plumage patches as agonistic signals in a small passerine, the golden whistler (Pachycephala pectoralis). Display signals in male golden whistlers include an unpigmented white throat patch, a carotenoid-based yellow breast and nape band, and a melanin-based black chin-stripe. We found that only the white throat patch was correlated with contest-related attributes. Males possessing large throat patches defended larger territories and commenced breeding earlier. When caged males with either experimentally reduced, or unmanipulated throat patches were presented to conspecifics, those with experimentally reduced patches attracted less aggression from male subjects. Focal males also responded faster to caged males with throat patches similar in size to their own, suggesting that they may assess relative throat patch size before engaging in aggressive encounters. Females did not discriminate between "reduced" or "control" treatments. Our data strongly suggest that only the unpigmented throat patch functions as a status signal. As this signal is unlikely to have significant development costs, honesty may be maintained through social costs. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={From 1993 to 1999, we conducted banding and telemetry studies of fall migrant Soras (Porzana carolina) in the historic rail hunting and exceptional stopover habitat of the Wild Rice (Zizania aquatica) marshes of the tidal Patuxent River. Drift traps equipped with audio lures produced 3,897 Sora and 417 Virginia Rail (Rallus limicola) captures during the seven-year study. Sora captures were characterized by a high proportion (70% to 90%) of young-of-the year and a paucity of between-year recaptures (N = 12). Radio-telemetry studies depicted Soras as long-distance migrants with high stopover survival and a critical dependence on tidal freshwater marshes for migratory fattening. Here, the high productivity of Wild Rice, Smartweeds (Polygonum spp.) and other seed-bearing annual plants seem intrinsically linked to Sora migratory fitness. A stopover period of >40 days and mean mass gain of +0.6g/d suggests Soras are accumulating large fat reserves for long-distance flight. Radio tracking confirmed Soras as strong flyers with a demonstrated overnight (ten h) flight range of 700-900+ km. Given the potential size of fat reserves and the ability to use tail winds, it is conceivable for Soras to make nonstop flights from the Patuxent River to Florida, the Bahamas, or even the Caribbean. Once a widely hunted species, a single sport-hunting recovery from our 3,900 bandings attests to the decline in popularity of the Sora as a game bird in the Atlantic Flyway. We suggest the few between-year recaptures observed in our bandings results from three possible factors: 1) the strong influence of wind drift on migration, 2) different migration chronology or flight path of AHY versus HY birds, and/or 3) high mortality of especially HY birds during Atlantic coastal and Gulf crossings. The critical dependence of Soras and other seed-dependent, fall-migrant waterbirds on highly productive yet limited tidal freshwater marsh habitats make conservation of such areas a priority mission within the Chesapeake Bay.},

abstract={Radio-telemetry is often used to track birds, and several investigators have examined the possible effects of radio-transmitters on birds. One approach to this question is to determine if transmitters induce physiological stress. Using hematological indicators of stress (heterophil-lymphocyte [H/L[ ratios), studies of captive birds have revealed no evidence that radio-transmitters cause stress. However, studies in captivity may not reflect conditions faced by birds in the wild, especially during energetically demanding times, such as the overwintering period. We examined the possible effect of backpack-style transmitters on overwintering Hermit Thrushes (Catharus guttatus) in South Carolina by examining H/L ratios from blood smears made before and after transmitter attachment. We captured and recaptured eight thrushes in an early winter period and 11 in a late winter period, and in both cases found that H/L ratios did not change after 1 mo of carrying transmitters. H/L ratios also did not differ significantly (in either trial) between thrushes with and without transmitters. Furthermore, thrushes that carried transmitters during both of our trials did not have higher final H/L ratios than those that carried transmitters during just one trial (the late winter). These results indicate that carrying backpack-style transmitters for 1 mo did not induce stress in overwintering Hermit Thrushes. These results are consistent with studies of captive birds, and provide support for the continued use of backpack radio-transmitters in this species, as long as weight recommendations are met. © 2008 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Understanding how avian populations are structured spatially and temporally is fundamental to their effective conservation. Protecting migratory species in one jurisdiction or period of the annual cycle may be ineffective if they periodically move to areas where they are not protected or are exposed to factors that limit populations or cause their decline. Unfortunately, for most species, our understanding of connectivity between breeding, wintering or stopover sites during the annual cycle are poorly understood and there is an urgent need to define such connections in order to achieve more effective conservation. This paper provides an overview of the methods used to mark individuals in order to track their movements. Passive exogenous markers such as numbered rings or bands are typically ineffective for most avian species. Active exogenous markers such as satellite tags have provided significant breakthroughs but are still prohibitive financially and still cannot be applied to species under 200g. Endogenous markers such as DNA markers, trace elements and stable isotopes show significant promise as a means of moving forward the field of animal tracking. The advantage of these endogenous approaches is that they depend only on sampling a population once and so are not biased by limitations of markrecapture methods. Nonetheless, all methods have disadvantages and the path ahead must consider multiple approaches to tracking avian populations. © 2008 BirdLife International.},

abstract={The population of Dusky Canada Geese (Branta canadensis occidentalis) has been in long-term decline, likely due to reduced breeding productivity. To identify causes of mortality, we monitored goslings marked with radio transmitters on the western Copper River Delta, Alaska, from 1997 to 1999. Almost all gosling mortality (96%; 81 of 84) was due to predation, with mink (Mustela vison) and Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) the most important predators. Bald Eagles are also major nest predators and, thus, appear to play a key role in limiting the breeding productivity of Dusky Canada Geese. Daily survival rate for goslings to 28 d of age was lower (0.011; 95% CI 0.002-0.024) for those with transmitters than for those without, but did not differ for older goslings (29-45 d). Although finer resolution in the timing of the transmitter effect within the first 28 d was not possible, we found that, by limiting our sample to goslings that survived until after 2-3 d posthatching, support for a transmitter effect was much reduced. Younger, smaller birds are inherently more vulnerable than older birds to transmitter effects. In addition, the process of radio-marking may have delayed the departure of goslings from nests and increased their risk of mortality shortly after hatching. Although radio transmitters may often be the only practical means for determining causes of mortality for young waterfowl, we suggest caution in using transmitters because of their potential negative effects, particularly during the first few days after hatching. © 2008 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Descriptions of realized variations, correlations, and covariations among physical attributes (phenotypic integration) provide a useful framework for understanding evolutionary pathways and the generation of diversity. The ability of many birds to see near-ultraviolet (UV) light, which is invisible to normal humans, has focused attention on special properties of 'hidden' UV plumage signals. Little is known, however, about associations between UV (320-400 nm) and longer-wavelength visible (400-700 nm) reflectance, or how such patterns compare to those among longer-wavelength visible reflectance components alone. Analysis of physical reflectance from most carotenoid-bearing yellow, orange, and red plumage patches of male tanager-finch (Thraupini, Emberizinae) species revealed that amounts of longer-wavelength visible and UV reflectance components expressed different patterns of covariation with the spectral location of the main longer-wavelength visible reflectance band (cut-off wavelength, associated with 'redness'). Longer-wavelength visible components were linear (y = x) functions of cut-off wavelength, whereas UV components were nonlinear cubic polynomial (y = x3 - x2 + x) functions of cut-off wavelength. The more complex UV-related patterns consisted essentially of two parallel curves partially separated by a gap such that: (1) each curve was associated with a different family of carotenoid pigments and was centred at different (relatively shorter versus longer) cut-off wavelengths; (2) each curve described a negative relationship between the amount of UV and the cut-off wavelength; (3) modifications to feather branching structure tracked the negative trend of each curve; (4) the gap between curves existed because plumages with intermediate cut-off wavelengths lacked moderate to high UV reflectance; and (5) functional relationships persisted when phylogeny and other confounding effects (age of study skin, breeding season) were taken into account. Thus, phenotypic integration between UV and long-wavelength visible reflectance can be just as distinctive as reflectance patterns restricted to the UV. Moreover, by contrast to the view that plumage ornaments are relatively unconstrained aspects of morphology, the highly regular phenotypic patterns expressed by carotenoid-bearing plumages suggest that reflectance evolves within specific limits, even in the context of an extensive ecological radiation. Indeed, the near-exhaustive sampling of taxa implies that gaps in the observed phenotype space correspond to plumages that have not evolved in this avian clade. Much of the curve/gap structure is consistent with what is known about the physics, chemistry, and metabolism of carotenoids in these or related birds, including, for example, that only certain subclasses of carotenoids are used for plumage displays. The key contribution that UV makes to the expression of these patterns suggests that avian UV sensitivity enhances the information content and honesty of carotenoid-bearing plumage signals compared to what humans perceive. The structure of phenotype space reveals that a complex interplay between extrinsic (dietary, ecological) and intrinsic (physico-chemical, physiologic) factors ultimately determines plumage variation. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London.},

Our trap was developed to capture wading birds in the Florida Everglades in water less than 30 cm deep, but could also be used to capture other waterbirds and upland species. The primary advantages of this new trap design are its ability to be easily concealed, ability to selectively capture birds, low injury rate, ease of resetting the trap after captures, minimal training requirements for operator, capacity to be fired remotely, and moderate cost. We also evaluated the effectiveness of using a net gun to capture wading birds in wetlands. Our results demonstrated that the net gun was the most effective method for capturing large numbers of wading birds, however, the modified flip trap provides a safer alternative that may be appropriate for endangered species. © 2008 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Of the transmitter attachment techniques for birds, the subcutaneous anchor provides a secure attachment that yields relatively few secondary effects. However, the use of subcutaneous anchors has been limited by transmitter size and retention time. Using a modified method of attachment that utilized two subcutaneous anchors, we deployed 69 GPS transmitters, plus 13 VHF transmitters that were similar in size and weight to GPS models, on Pacific Black Brant (Branta bernicla nigricans). Prior to our study, only harnesses were used for attaching GPS transmitters on birds, mainly because GPS transmitters are too large for other external attachment techniques and implantation in the body cavity attenuates the GPS signal. Thus, to increase the size capacity of anchor attachment and to avoid the well-documented negative effects of harnesses on behavior and survival, we added a second anchor at the transmitter's posterior end. The double-anchor attachment technique was quickly and easily accomplished in the field, requiring bird handling times of <10 min. Incidental recoveries of tagged Brant indicate a high degree of transmitter retention. Five recaptured birds (4-6 weeks after deployment) and eight killed by hunters (3-6 mo after deployment) retained their GPS transmitters. For studies involving the use of relatively large transmitters, the double-anchor method appears to provide a viable alternative for external attachment. © 2008 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={The level of site fidelity in birds is often characterized as "high" on the basis of rates of return or homing from mark-recapture data. For species that exhibit site fidelity, subsequent biological assumptions have included population structure, demographic independence, and that the extirpation of a site-faithful group might be irreversible because of low immigration. Yet several genetic studies have observed patterns of population differentiation that are incongruous with strong site fidelity, which suggests recent isolation, gene flow, or both. Using a 13-year live-recapture and dead-recovery data set, as well as nuclear and mitochondrial DNA collected across the range of the Hooded Merganser (Lophodytes cucullatus), an obligate cavity-nester endemic to North America, we found evidence that gene flow persists across portions of the species' range even though the probability of female breeding-site fidelity is high (0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.64-0.98) and disjunct breeding ranges of this species have been isolated for ≥10,000 years. By combining inferences from genetic, band-recovery, mark-recapture, and comparative data from another cavity-nesting species of waterfowl, we conclude that a high level of site fidelity should not be considered a universal proxy for population structure and demographic independence. Our results also suggest that an accurate assessment of site fidelity-and its implications for population dynamics and delineation-requires cross-species comparisons and multiple data types, such as mark-recapture and genetic information, to best infer patterns across a range of geographic and temporal scales. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2008.},

abstract={The traditional method of identifying wildlife habitat distribution over large regions consists of pixel-based classification of satellite images into a suite of habitat classes used to select suitable habitat patches. Object-based classification is a new method that can achieve the same objective based on the segmentation of spectral bands of the image creating homogeneous polygons with regard to spatial or spectral characteristics. The segmentation algorithm does not solely rely on the single pixel value, but also on shape, texture, and pixel spatial continuity. The object-based classification is a knowledge base process where an interpretation key is developed using ground control points and objects are assigned to specific classes according to threshold values of determined spectral and/or spatial attributes. We developed a model using the eCognition software to identify suitable habitats for the Grasshopper Sparrow, a rare and declining species found in southwestern Québec. The model was developed in a region with known breeding sites and applied on other images covering adjacent regions where potential breeding habitats may be present. We were successful in locating potential habitats in areas where dairy farming prevailed but failed in an adjacent region covered by a distinct Landsat scene and dominated by annual crops. We discuss the added value of this method, such as the possibility to use the contextual information associated to objects and the ability to eliminate unsuitable areas in the segmentation and land cover classification processes, as well as technical and logistical constraints. A series of recommendations on the use of this method and on conservation issues of Grasshopper Sparrow habitat is also provided. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

Over 4 years 22 Elaphe and 16 Coluber were radio-tracked at the same site in Illinois to examine how movement and home ranges varied by sex and season. 3. Coluber moved more often and further per move than Elaphe, resulting in their estimated mean day range being almost four times larger than that of Elaphe (88.0 m day-1 vs. 23.1 m day-1). 4. Both male and female Elaphe moved more frequently early in the season consistent with mate-searching, but mean distances moved did not differ seasonally or by sex. Both sexes of Coluber moved more later in the season and overall males moved further than females. 5. Interspecifically, patterns were consistent with the energetics hypothesis - Coluber had mean home ranges approximately four times larger than those of Elaphe. 6. Intraspecifically, increased movement did not always produce larger home ranges. Male Elaphe had larger home ranges than females despite not moving further, whereas male Coluber had comparable home ranges to females despite moving further. Also, Elaphe home ranges in Illinois were substantially smaller than has been documented in Ontario, despite Ontario Elaphe moving less. 7.

We marked 53 adult female emperor geese with satellite transmitters on the YKD in 1999, 2002, and 2003 to examine whether chronology of migration or use of seasonal habitats differed among birds that wintered in different regions. Females that migrated relatively short distances (650-1010 km) between the YKD and winter sites on the south side of the Alaska Peninsula bypassed autumn staging areas on the Bering Sea coast of the Alaska Peninsula or used them for shorter periods (mean = 57 days) than birds that made longer migrations (1600-2640 km) to the western Aleutian Islands (mean = 97 days). Alaska Peninsula migrants spent more days at winter sites (mean =172 days, 95% CI: 129-214 days) than western Aleutian Island migrants (mean = 91 days, 95% CI: 83-99 days). Birds that migrated 930-1610 km to the eastern Aleutian Islands spent intermediate intervals at fall staging (mean = 77 days) and wintering areas (mean = 108 days, 95% CI: 95-119 days). Return dates to the YKD did not differ among birds that wintered in different regions. Coastal staging areas on the Alaska Peninsula may be especially important in autumn to prepare Aleutian migrants physiologically for long-distance migration to winter sites, and in spring to enable emperor geese that migrate different distances to reach comparable levels of condition before nesting. © The Arctic Institute of North America.},

abstract={In an attempt to reduce the high extinction risk inherent to small island populations, we translocated wild Laysan teal Anas laysanensis to a portion of its presumed prehistoric range. Most avian translocations lack the strategic post-release monitoring needed to assess early population establishment or failure. Therefore, we monitored the survival and reproduction of all founders, and their first-generation offspring using radio telemetry for 2 years after the first release. Forty-two Laysan teal were sourced directly from the only extant population on Laysan Island and transported 2 days by ship to Midway Atoll. All birds survived the translocation with nutritional and veterinary support, and spent between 4 and 14 days in captivity. Post-release survival of 42 founders was 0.857 (95% CI 0.86-0.99) during 2004-2006 or annualized 0.92 (95% CI 0.83-0.98). Seventeen of 18 founding hens attempted nesting in the first two breeding seasons. Fledgling success was 0.57 (95% CI 0.55-0.60) in 2005 and 0.63 (95% CI 0.62-0.64) in 2006. The effective founding female population (Ne) was 13. We applied these initial demographic rates to model population growth. The nascent population size increased to &gt;100 after only 2 years post-release (λ = 1.73). If this growth rate continues, the size of the Midway population could surpass the source population before 2010. © 2008 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2008 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract={We examined mercury concentrations and space use of prebreeding Forster's terns (Sterna forsteri) in San Francisco Bay, California, USA, to assess factors influencing mercury levels in piscivorous birds. In 2005 and 2006, we collected blood and feathers from 122 Forster's terns and radio-marked and tracked 72 terns to determine locations of dietary mercury uptake. Capture site and capture date were the most important factors explaining variation in blood mercury concentrations (geometric mean ± standard error: 1.09 ± 0.89 μg/g wet wt), followed by sex and year. Accordingly, radiotelemetry data revealed that Forster's terns generally remained near their site of capture and foraged in nearby salt ponds, managed and tidal marshes, and tidal flats. In contrast, capture site and capture date were not important factors explaining variation in feather mercury concentrations, probably because feathers were grown on their wintering grounds several months prior to our sampling. Instead, sex and year were the most important factors explaining mercury concentrations in breast feathers (9.57 ± 8.23 μg/g fresh wt), and sex was the most important factor for head feathers (6.94 ± 7.04 μg/g fresh wt). Overall, 13 and 22% of prebreeding Forster's terns were estimated to be at high risk for deleterious effects due to mercury concentrations in blood (>3.0 μg/g wet wt) and feathers (>20.0 μg/g fresh wt), respectively. Breeding terns are likely to be even more at risk because blood mercury concentrations more than tripled during the 45-d prebreeding time period. These data illustrate the importance of space use and tissue type in interpreting mercury concentrations in birds. © 2008 SETAC.},

abstract={As central-place foragers, colonial seabirds should be able to compensate, up to some threshold, for changing breeding conditions by remaining flexible in the amount of time allocated to foraging versus other activities. Black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) colonies in Chiniak Bay, Kodiak Island, Alaska experienced high productivity from 2001 to 2003 and virtually no productivity from 2004 to 2005. In the absence of disease epidemics, increased human disturbance or predation, we applied multilevel, mixed, regression models to assess the hypothesis that the collapse from high to low breeding success was due primarily to changes in prey availability. Under this hypothesis, we predicted that longer foraging trips would be associated with reduced breeding performance in cohorts of kittiwakes-groups marked with radio-transmitters at the same colony in the same year. We separately modeled two response variables: foraging trip-durations made during the incubation and early chick stages. Multilevel mixed models revealed only weak variation at the cohort-level in either response variable; hatching success and fledging success accounted for none or less than 2% of the total variation in trip-durations made during the incubation and early chick stages, respectively. The majority of the variation in our response variables was at the observation (ca. 80-90%) and bird (or individual) levels (ca. 10-12%). Our results expose the unreliability of using indirect evidence to implicate prey availability as the primary cause of widespread breeding failures in colonial seabirds. In the ecological literature, two types of inferences seem particularly vulnerable to indirect evidence: inferences following studies on species that are accepted or strongly promoted as bioindicators of changes in marine productivity such as the black-legged kittiwake, and inferences that implicate a fisheries-induced reduction in prey availability to failed breeding. In light of these pitfalls, we recommend that long-term monitoring studies on kittiwakes and other seabirds carefully consider in their study designs and implementations multiple working hypotheses that might explain major changes in breeding success. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Several species of Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbirds appear to form roosting aggregations while on their wintering grounds but little is understood about the ecology of this behavior. We studied roosting behavior and patterns of roost habitat selection in the northern waterthrush Seiurus noveboracensis, during three winter years (2002-2004) in Puerto Rico using radio telemetry. Overall, red mangrove was selected for roosting disproportionately to its availability. Regardless of diurnal habitat used, 87% (n = 86) of northern waterthrush selected dense stands of coastal red mangrove for roost sites. Individuals traveled up to 2 km to access roost sites in this habitat on a daily basis. The majority (8 of 14) of individuals roosted alone, while others roosted in loose aggregations near communal roosts of gray kingbirds Tyrannus dominicensis. Patterns of roost site selection did not vary by sex. Individuals showing aggressive response to playback during the day, however, selected roost sites significantly closer to the coast. Several additional migratory and resident bird species also used red mangrove for night-time roosting habitat. Red mangrove may be a critical nocturnal roosting habitat for bird populations that live in proximity to coastal areas in the Neotropics. The benefits of nocturnal roosting behavior as well as why individuals appear to select red mangrove remain poorly understood. © 2008 The Authors. J. Compilation © 2008 J. Avian Biol.},

abstract={1. Synchronized mass production of seed crops, such as acorns, produces a resource pulse that may have far-reaching consequences for songbird populations through its effects on avian predators. Seed production in these forests represents only the first of several pulsed events. Secondary pulses emerge as mast-consuming rodents numerically respond to seed production and tertiary pulses emerge as generalist predators, such as raptors, numerically respond to rodents. In turn, these two groups reduce nest productivity and juvenile survivorship 1 and 2 years, respectively, after the initial pulse in seed production. 2. At our study site in south-eastern New York, USA, autumn acorn abundance (primary pulse) largely determines rodent abundance (secondary pulse) the following spring. We tested the hypotheses that the population dynamics of a shrub-nesting passerine (wood thrush Hylocichla mustelina), is influenced by rodents through the: (a) direct effect of predation by rodents; (b) indirect effect of rodents on the abundance of raptors (tertiary pulse); and (c) indirect effect of rodent abundance on raptor diet. The latter specifically hypothesizes that a crash in the rodent population in the wake of region-wide failure of acorn production leads to an extreme diet shift in raptors that increases post-fledging mortality in birds. 3. We conducted a 3-year study to examine variation in wood thrush nest success and fledgling survival, using radio telemetry, across a pulse of rodent abundance (i.e. low, medium and high). We also updated and reanalysed regional wood thrush population growth rates as a function of the annual variation in rodent abundance. 4. Fledgling survivorship, but not nest success, varied in relation to annual rodent abundance. Raptors and eastern chipmunks Tamias striatus were the most commonly identified predators on fledglings. Fledgling survivorship was greatest at intermediate rodent abundance consistent with a shift in raptor diet. Regional rate of wood thrush population growth showed a unimodal relationship with rodent abundance, peaking during years with intermediate rodent abundance. This unimodal pattern was due to wood thrush population growth rates near or below zero during rodent population crashes. 5. The telemetry study, pattern of regional abundance and synchronized population dynamics of coexisting thrushes suggest a common mechanism of behavioural changes in raptors in response to declines in rodent prey, which in turn affects thrush population dynamics. © 2008 The Authors.},

abstract={Estimating total number of birds using a particular staging site during migration is challenging because counts alone do not account for turnover in the local population. Robust statistical methods are needed to more fully assess the conservation value of such sites. We used the multi-strata model in Program MARK to estimate time-dependent transition probabilities between sequential staging sites to estimate lengths of stay for spring-staging Pacific black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) on the Fraser River delta and Parksville-Qyalicum areas in the Strait of Georgia, British Columbia, Canada. Using resightings of marked individuals in combination with ground counts, we estimated the total number of brant, with associated uncertainties, staging at these sites during the spring migrations of 1999 and 2000. We estimated between 28,927 and 33,181 individual brant transited the Fraser River delta and Parksville-Qualicum sites in 1999 and between 21,621 and 25,405 individuals in 2000. These totals correspond to approximately 18-26% of the entire Pacific Flyway brant population, suggesting the need for continued conservation and management efforts at these sites. Given the importance of staging sites to migratory populations, we believe this method could be applied to other species and locations.},

All Ovenbirds roosted within their daytime home range and most individuals roosted within the core of their diurnal home range. Sixty-six percent of individuals roosted within the 30% core use distribution (i.e., most heavily used portion of their home range) and 35% of individuals roosted within the 10% core. The average distance between roost sites for 29 individuals located on more than one night was 34 m and at least three birds roosted solitarily in the same location on different nights. Roost location relative to the 10% core area of diurnal home range did not differ between males and females, adults and immatures, or between individuals studied in subsequent years. The wintering Ovenbird population we studied appeared to roost solitarily. This study is the first to provide quantitative evidence that individual migrant songbirds in a tropical wintering population consistently roost at night within their foraging home range. These results suggest that roosting behavior is correlated with daytime space use patterns of the winter social system.},

Space use measurements (linear movements, home ranges, core areas, and average distance from nest) varied significantly among breeding stages. Space use was greatest for the post-breeding stage, followed by pre-incubation, incubation, and brood-rearing. Most avocet nests (93%) were located within their pre-incubation core area boundaries, whereas only 36% of nests were within post-breeding core areas. Distance between daily location and future nest sites decreased significantly as the number of days prior to incubation decreased, suggesting that avocets prospected future nest sites several weeks prior to nesting. These data indicate that breeding stage influences space use of female American Avocets and illustrates the importance of delineating breeding stages to better understand space use of avian species.},

abstract={Breeding bird surveys indicate a long-term decline in numbers of scoters (Melanitta spp.) breeding in North America. Little is known about the breeding habitat and reproductive life history of White-winged Scoters (M. fusca) in their primary breeding areas in the boreal forest of Alaska and northern Canada. We characterized selection of nest habitats and attributes within those habitats by measuring variables at nests and random sites on the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska. White-winged Scoters avoided nesting in meadows, but nested in scrub or forested habitat types in proportion to their availability (χ25 = 9.7, P = 0.08). Nests of radio-marked females were farther from water and edge (+210 ± 43 and +10 ± 4 m, respectively), and in slightly thicker cover (+6 ± 4%) than nests located without aid of radio transmitters. Females selected sites with more variable and abundant overhead and lateral cover, and sites closer to edge and water than random sites. The results imply nearly random use of scrub and forested habitat types within the study area, but selective use of attributes within those habitat types. This generalist approach to nest site selection at a larger scale may be an adaptive response to reduce detection by nest predators. Nests located without use of radio-marked females may not be representative of the population of nests at a study site. White-winged Scoters often selected nest sites with dense cover far from water, which may increase nest survival. However, concealed sites are difficult for heavy-bodied birds to escape and females may be trading productivity against their own mortality.},

abstract={Feathers are complex integumentary appendages of birds and some other theropod dinosaurs. They are frequently coloured and function in camouflage and display. Previous investigations have concluded that fossil feathers are preserved as carbonized traces composed of feather-degrading bacteria. Here, an investigation of a colour-banded feather from the Lower Cretaceous Crato Formation of Brazil revealed that the dark bands are preserved as elongate, oblate carbonaceous bodies 1-2μm long, whereas the light bands retain only relief traces on the rock matrix. Energy dispersive X-ray analysis showed that the dark bands preserve a substantial amount of carbon, whereas the light bands show no carbon residue. Comparison of these oblate fossil bodies with the structure of black feathers from a living bird indicates that they are the eumelanin-containing melanosomes. We conclude that most fossil feathers are preserved as melanosomes, and that the distribution of these structures in fossil feathers can preserve the colour pattern in the original feather. The discovery of preserved melanosomes opens up the possibility of interpreting the colour of extinct birds and other dinosaurs. © 2008 The Royal Society.},

abstract={The use of bird counts as indices has come under increasing scrutiny because assumptions concerning detection probabilities may not be met, but there also seems to be some resistance to use of model-based approaches to estimating abundance. We used data from the United States Forest Service, Southern Region bird monitoring program to compare several common approaches for estimating annual abundance or indices and population trends from point-count data. We compared indices of abundance estimated as annual means of counts and from a mixed-Poisson model to abundance estimates from a count-removal model with 3 time intervals and a distance model with 3 distance bands. We compared trend estimates calculated from an autoregressive, exponential model fit to annual abundance estimates from the above methods and also by estimating trend directly by treating year as a continuous covariate in the mixed-Poisson model. We produced estimates for 6 forest songbirds based on an average of 621 and 459 points in 2 physiographic areas from 1997 to 2004. There was strong evidence that detection probabilities varied among species and years. Nevertheless, there was good overall agreement across trend estimates from the 5 methods for 9 of 12 comparisons. In 3 of 12 comparisons, however, patterns in detection probabilities potentially confounded interpretation of uncorrected counts. Estimates of detection probabilities differed greatly between removal and distance models, likely because the methods estimated different components of detection probability and the data collection was not optimally designed for either method. Given that detection probabilities often vary among species, years, and observers investigators should address detection probability in their surveys, whether it be by estimation of probability of detection and abundance, estimation of effects of key covariates when modeling count as an index of abundance, or through design-based methods to standardize these effects.},

abstract={The causes and consequences of nonbreeding space-use strategies are poorly understood. We studied 2 alternatives, sedentary and floating behaviors, in a wintering population of the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), a Neotropical-Nearctic migrant, in response to manipulated and natural variation in food availability over 4 years in Jamaica, West Indies. Using radio transmitters, we documented in sedentary individuals use of a fixed home range, greatly overlapping those of neighbors, as well as core areas that overlapped little, suggesting that Ovenbirds defend the core of their home range as a territory. Floaters included individuals with multiple disjoined home ranges and individuals that undertook frequent excursions, but floaters always occupied relatively large feeding areas. Floaters comprised 8-17% of the population, and in some individuals, the behavior persisted in multiple winters, but the behaviors were not sex or age restricted. Sedentary birds were attracted to artificial feeding stations located within their home range. However, reduction of food availability did not induce sedentary individuals to expand or shift their home range or to adopt floater behaviors. By contrast, floaters appeared better able to exploit seasonal or experimentally induced variation in food availability by matching their space use to the resources. The physical consequences of these alternative wintering strategies were situation dependent: Whereas body mass of territorial birds was positively correlated with food availability, floaters showed the opposite response, with higher mass in food-reduced situations. These results suggest that alternative behaviors represent a trade-off in response to resource availability. © The Author 2008.

abstract={Knowledge of how landscape structure influences patterns of animal space use is critical to developing sustainable landscape management practices. For breeding songbirds that defend a territory embedded within a larger home range, effects of structural change on movement may be manifested at multiple spatial scales. We used radio-telemetry to assess within-territory and home range space use as functions of the proportion of clearcut-harvested versus naturally unforested land for two species of Neotropical migrant songbirds. We tested whether these relationships varied with spatial scale by assessing landscape structure in both the local neighborhood (115 m radius around an individual's territory center) and across the landscape (1250 m radius). Territory size for riparian-associated male Northern Waterthrushes (Seiurus noveboracensis) was curvilinearly related to the proportion of harvested versus naturally unforested land and varied by greater than two orders of magnitude. Waterthrush territories were largest in the most heavily harvested landscapes. Home range space use by male Blackpoll Warblers (Dendroica striata), which are habitat generalists, was influenced by the ratio of clearcuts to natural gaps in both the neighborhood and landscape. Blackpolls may modify their behavior as a result of anthropogenic processes acting at both small and larger spatial scales, but we observed considerable interannual variability. Our results suggest that boreal forest-breeding passerines may be capable of modifying their space use behavior in response to moderate levels of structural change caused by forestry. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.},

abstract={We show that free-ranging Laughing Kookaburras (Dacelo novaeguineae), the largest kingfishers, are heterothermic. Their minimum recorded body temperature (Tb) was 28.6°C, and the maximum daily Tb range was 9.1°C, which makes kookaburras only the second coraciiform species and the only member of the Alcedinidae known to be heterothermic. The amplitude of nocturnal body temperature variation for wild, free-living kookaburras during winter was substantially greater than the mean of 2.6°C measured previously for captive kookaburras. Calculated metabolic savings from nocturnal heterothermia were up to 5.6 ± 0.9 kJ per night. There was little effect of ambient temperature on any of the calculated Tb -dependent variables for the kookaburras, although ambient temperature did influence the time that activity commenced for these diurnal birds. Kookaburras used endogenous metabolic heat production to rewarm from low Tb, rather than relying on passive rewarming. Rewarming rates (0.05 ± 0.01°C min-1) were consistent with those of other avian species. Captivity can have major effects on thermoregulation for birds, and therefore the importance of field studies of wild, free-living individuals is paramount for understanding the biology of avian temperature regulation. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.},

abstract={We used radio-telemetry to examine fine-scale movement patterns of Wilson's Warblers (Wilsonia pusilla) at a stopover site on the lower Colorado River during spring migration in 2005 and 2006. The overall movements of Wilson's Warblers were restricted to small, localized areas, with an average linear displacement of only 332 m. Warblers exhibited exploratory behavior characterized by fast, long-distance, directed linear movements during the first and second day after presumed arrival at the stopover site. However, exploration was limited within the overall landscape (<2 km diameter), suggesting a cost to extended exploration. As individuals gained more information about the distribution of resources at the stopover site through exploratory behavior and direct sampling of the habitat, movements became more aggregated within a localized area, suggesting that Wilson's Warblers settled within a microsite at the stopover site to replenish fuel supplies. The overall movement patterns exhibited by warblers during stopover were influenced by the age of the individual and changes in resources, both within a season and between years. Movement patterns of Wilson's Warblers documented during this study provide essential information about the temporal distribution of a warbler's locations within a stopover site, indicating how birds search for and acquire food resources throughout their stopover. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.},

abstract={Understanding the patterns, extent, and phenology of migration is important for estimating potential influences of habitat or climate changes on populations of migratory birds. We used satellite telemetry of >100 individual King Eiders (Somateria spectabilis) tagged in northwestern North America in 2002-2006 to describe the timing and extent of their migration and winter movements in the Bering Sea. We found high variability in timing of migration events and distances flown. Arrival on breeding grounds and onset of molt migration were the least variable events in duration. Fall migration was extremely variable, ranging from less than a week to several months. More than a third of King Eiders did not migrate after wing molt and wintered on or near wing-molting areas. We found diffuse migratory connectivity between breeding and wintering areas, and low intrayear fidelity to 25 km radius wintering sites. More than half of the King Eiders used several wintering sites in a given year, and their winter ranges were considerably larger than those of other sea duck species. We identified three distinct wintering regions in the Bering Sea that were several hundred km apart, among which no movements occurred from late December until April. The onset of spring migration was earlier for birds wintering farther south, but arrival time on breeding grounds was not correlated with wintering latitude. We conclude that high phenotypic plasticity in migratory traits may render King Eiders more likely to respond to environmental shifts than sea duck species that show stronger migratory connectivity. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2008.},

abstract={Since 1992, efforts to recover the US federally endangered Great Lakes piping plover (Charadrius melodus) have included population supplementation with captive-reared young raised from abandoned eggs. Using banding data collected 1993-2008 and Cormack-Jolly-Seber models in program MARK we estimated resighting rates (ρ) and apparent survival (Φ) of first-year (1) and after-first-year (2+) plovers. Reproductive success was measured by estimating mean number of eggs laid, chicks hatched and chicks fledged per wild-reared or captive-reared parent, and these values were compared with a permutation test. The best-supported mark-resighting model indicated wild-reared plovers had higher Φ1 and Φ2+ than captive-reared plovers. Breeding propensity influenced detection of wild plovers, whereas unique band combinations facilitated detection of yearling captive-reared plovers. Captive-reared (n = 10) and wild-reared (n = 57) plovers laid similar numbers of eggs, but wild-reared plovers hatched 36% more chicks and fledged 56% more young. Reproductive values derived from matrix models suggest captive-reared piping plovers are less fit than similarly aged wild-reared birds upon release and demonstrate reduced fitness in subsequent years. The Great Lakes captive-rearing effort has successfully produced a minimum of 10 breeding adults from 192 eggs that otherwise would have had no reproductive value; these captive-reared individuals now constitute up to 3% of the total population. Small scale salvage and captive-rearing of abandoned eggs should be considered as a technique to supplement existing recovery efforts in highly imperiled populations. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Estimates of distributions of natal dispersal distances and juvenile recruitment rates in open populations are strongly influenced by the extent and shape of the areas sampled. Techniques to improve biased dispersal and survival estimates include area-ratio methods based on weighting observations by sampling effort, the extent and shape of the area sampled, and the amount and distribution of preferred habitat surrounding the area sampled. We partitioned territories within the boundaries of a large, almost geographically closed, population of individually marked Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and estimated dispersal and survival parameters from hypothetical smaller study areas (sampling areas) of varying sizes and shapes in order to examine whether an area-ratio method provides accurate or improved estimates of juvenile dispersal distance and survival. Non-aggregated sampling areas resulted in the detection of fewer dispersal events, but because of their large spatial extent, produced unbiased dispersal estimates. The use of aggregated sampling areas (circular or linear) resulted in the detection of higher numbers of dispersal events, but produced biased dispersal estimates that were generally improved by the area-ratio method. Area-ratio corrections usually provided better estimates of median dispersal distance than uncorrected estimates. Survival to breeding was usually underestimated and often not improved by the area-ratio method, regardless of extent and shape of the sampling area. Estimates of juvenile survival to breeding were improved by assuming that rates of emigration were equivalent to immigration, and correcting survival estimates accordingly. Small, local studies should use an area-ratio method to improve their estimates of median dispersal distance. Because the correction method estimates relative, but not absolute, numbers of individuals dispersing across distance categories, the area-ratio method should not be used for estimating survival. Non-aggregated sampling areas may be an effective design to increase spatial extent (and thus decrease bias) without proportionately increasing the amount of habitat sampled. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The current biodiversity crisis is characterized by the decline and extinction of numerous animal populations and species world-wide. To aid in understanding the threats and causes of population decline and the assessment of endangerment status of a species, conservation scientists and practitioners are increasingly relying on remote assessments using biotelemetry (radio telemetry, acoustic telemetry, satellite tracking) and biologging (archival loggers) or hybrid technologies (e.g. pop-up satellite tags). These tools offer increasingly sophisticated means (e.g. large-scale telemetry arrays, fine-scale positioning, and use of physiological and environmental sensors) of evaluating the behaviour, spatial ecology, energetics and physiology of free-living animals in their natural environment. Regional, national, and international threat assessments (e.g. the International Union for the Conservation of Nature [IUCN] Red List) require basic knowledge of animal distribution, emigration, behaviour, reproductive potential, mortality rates, and habitat use, which in many cases can all be obtained through biotelemetry and biologging studies. Such studies are particularly useful for understanding the basic biology of animals living in harsh environments (e.g. polar regions, aquatic environments), for rapidly moving or cryptic animals, and for those that undertake large-scale movements/migrations (e.g. birds, insects, marine mammals and fish). The premise of this paper is that biotelemetry and biologging have much to offer and should be embraced by the conservation science community to aid in assessment of threats and endangerment status. It is crucial that studies on endangered species must not further contribute to species decline or retard recovery. As such, there are complicated ethical and legal considerations that must be considered prior to implementing tracking studies on endangered wildlife. Furthermore, as many endangered animal species occur in developing countries, there is a need to develop capacity (financial support for the research and technical telemetry skills) for designing and conducting tracking studies. To stem the loss of biodiversity and aid in the recovery of endangered animal populations, there is a need for innovative and interdisciplinary research, monitoring programs and research initiatives to inform decision makers. It is clear that biotelemetry and biologging are not a panacea; however, they are valuable tools available to conservation practitioners. Used appropriately, biotelemetry and biologging have the potential to provide data that is often unattainable using other techniques, and can reduce uncertainty in the assignment of conservation status. © Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract={Identification of wintering regions for birds sampled during the breeding season is crucial to understanding how events outside the breeding season may affect populations. We assigned king eiders captured on breeding grounds in northern Alaska to 3 broad geographic wintering regions in the Bering Sea using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes obtained from head feathers. Using a discriminant function analysis of feathers obtained from birds tracked with satellite transmitters, we estimated that 88 % of feathers were assigned to the region in which they were grown. We then assigned 84 birds of unknown origin to wintering regions based on their head feather isotope ratios, and tested the utility of claws for geographic assignment. Based on the feather results, we estimated that similar proportions of birds in our study area use each of the 3 wintering regions in the Bering Sea. These results are in close agreement with estimates from satellite telemetry and show the usefulness of stable isotope signatures of feathers in assigning marine birds to geographic regions. The use of claws is currently limited by incomplete understanding of claw growth rates. Data presented here will allow managers of eiders, other marine birds, and marine mammals to assign animals to regions in the Bering Sea based on stable isotope signatures of body tissues. © Inter-Research 2008.},

abstract={An important assumption of mark-recapture studies is that individuals retain their marks, which has not been assessed for goose reward bands. We estimated aluminum leg band retention probabilities and modeled how band retention varied with band type (standard vs. reward band), band age (1-40 months), and goose characteristics (species and size class) for Canada (Branta canadensis), cackling (Branta hutchinsii), snow (Chen caerulescens), and Ross's (Chen rossii) geese that field coordinators double-leg banded during a North American goose reward band study (N = 40,999 individuals from 15 populations). We conditioned all models in this analysis on geese that were encountered with ≥1 leg band still attached (n = 5,747 dead recoveries and live recaptures). Retention probabilities for standard aluminum leg bands were high (θS = 0.9995, SE &lt; 0.001) and constant over 1-40 months. In contrast, apparent retention probabilities for reward bands demonstrated an interactive relationship between 5 size and species classes (small cackling, medium Canada, large Canada, snow, and Ross's geese). In addition, apparent retention probabilities for each of the 5 classes varied quadratically with time, being lower immediately after banding and at older age classes. The differential retention probabilities among band type (reward vs. standard) that we observed suggests that 1) models estimating reporting probability should incorporate differential band loss if it is nontrivial, 2) goose managers should consider the costs and benefits of double-banding geese on an operational basis, and 3) the United States Geological Survey Bird Banding Lab should modify protocols for receiving recovery data.},

To assess possible changes in condition, 20 radiotagged and 25 nontagged Savannah Sparrows were captured and recaptured throughout the postfledging period. We used four measures of condition: mass, an index of fat free dry mass (measured via heavy water dilution), pectoral muscle depth (measured via ultrasound imaging), and an index of fat mass (measured via heavy water dilution). Using both a generalized linear modeling framework and paired design, we found no significant differences in the body condition of radiotagged and nontagged adults and juveniles.

abstract={Although radio telemetry can provide useful information, the possible negative effects of transmitters, including biased results and detrimental effects on the birds, must also be considered. Several investigators have examined the effects of transmitters on larger birds, but few have examined their possible long-term effects, as assessed by return rates, on small passerines. We examined the possible negative effects of transmitters on a small (15.5 g) passerine. We used glue to attach radio transmitters to 40 male Swainson's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii) at two study sites in Arkansas in 2005 and 2006. To assess possible effects of transmitters on survival, we compared the following-year return rates of radio-tagged birds to birds that were captured and color banded, but did not receive transmitters. Least squared mean return rates for all birds ranged between 0.46 and 0.57. We found no significant difference in the following-year return rate of radio-tagged and nonradio-tagged birds. In addition, we found no significant differences in return rates between study sites or years, and no significant interactions between any combination of radio transmitter (radio tagged or not), site, and year. Our results indicate that attachment of transmitters did not affect return rates of male Swainson's Warblers and that the glue-on technique is a good option for short-term studies of small passerines. © 2009 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Previous studies have revealed that radio-transmitters may affect bird behaviors, including feeding rates, foraging behavior, vigilance, and preening behavior. In addition, depending on the method of attachment, transmitters can potentially affect the ability of cavity-nesting birds to use cavities. Our objective was to evaluate effects of transmitters on the behavior of and use of cavities by Red-headed Woodpeckers (Melanerpes erythrocephalus). Using backpack harnesses, we attached 2.1-g transmitter packages that averaged 3.1% of body weight (range = 2.5-3.6%) to Red-headed Woodpeckers. We observed both radio-tagged (N = 23) and nonradio-tagged (N = 28) woodpeckers and determined the percentage of time spent engaged in each of five behaviors: flight, foraging, perching, preening, and territorial behavior. We found no difference between the two groups in the percentage of time engaged in each behavior. In addition, we found that transmitters had no apparent effect on use of cavities for roosting by radio-tagged woodpeckers (N = 25). We conclude that backpack transmitters weighing less than 3.6% of body weight had no impact on either their behavior or their ability to use cavities. © 2009 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Chukars (Alectoris chukar) have been introduced throughout the world. Despite this widespread distribution, limited information regarding seasonal survival, probable causes of mortality, and other basic life history characteristics is available to manage this harvested species. We estimated the probable cause of mortality for chukars with radiotransmitters by examining evidence at kill sites. We used model selection to evaluate influences of seasonal effects (fall raptor migration, peak migration, and reproductive period), demographic effects (age and sex), radio weight, and year on survival of chukars in western Utah, USA, by using a known-fate model in Program MARK and 2 years of telemetry data. We captured and randomly fitted 125 individual chukars with 2 different-sized radiotransmitters (97 F, 20 M, 8 sex undetermined). Model selection results showed our top 3 models accounted for 99% of Akaike's Information Criterion weight, and each one had seasonal and year effects. Two-week survival estimates were lower during peak raptor migration in both years and significantly (P < 0.05) so in year 2 (2-week S = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.77-0.94) compared with other year 2 intervals (2-week S > 0.91). Annual survival was lower in 2005 (S = 0.03, 95% CI = 0.01-0.09) compared with 2006 (S = 0.19, 95% CI = 0.12-0.31). We documented 95 deaths and classified 56% unknown, 33% avian predation, 8% hunter harvest, and 3% mammalian predation. Our research suggests that predation on chukars is substantial during the peak fall raptor migratory period and that the hunting take under current regulations is relatively small and likely compensatory.},

abstract={Due to their predatory nature, raptor species may serve as important indicators of environmental contamination with antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. Raptors prey on small rodents and birds that have diverse habitat ranges, including urban and rural environments, and their intestinal microflora can reflect that of the animals on which they feed. Enterococcus spp. were selected as target organisms because they have been isolated from the avian gastrointestinal tract, can be conferred by prey items, and because they are capable of multiple resistance patterns. They are also a concerning source of human antimicrobial resistance. In this study fecal cultures were obtained from 15 May 2004 to 31 August 2004, from 21 free-living raptors and four captive raptors. Enterococcus was isolated from 21 (84%) of the 25 birds, and 54 isolates were chosen for further study based upon unique colony morphology. The most common isolate recovered was Enterococcus faecalis (95%, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 89-100). One bird in the study was determined to have Enterococcus gallinarum. Two distinct ribotypes of E. faecalis were identified, one with unique bands at 11 and 13 kb and the other with unique bands at 14 and 20 kb. Both ribotypes were found in free-living and captive birds. The Enterococcus isolates in this study demonstrated a variety of antimicrobial-resistance characteristics, including almost complete resistance to amikacin, first-generation cephalosporins, spectinomycin, and sulphadimethoxime. Isolates demonstrated variable resistance to chloramphenicol, gentamicin, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, and ticarcillin, No phenotypically vancomycin-resistant E. faecalis isolates were recovered from any of the raptors; three isolates had intermediate level susceptibility. A significantly higher number of isolates collected from captive birds demonstrated resistance to chloramphenicol than those obtained from free-living birds. This trend was not duplicated with any of the remaining 18 antimicrobial drugs tested. The results of this study suggest that raptors in central Illinois are coming into contact with antimicrobials, prey exposed to antimicrobials, or bacteria that are capable of transferring resistance genes. Further study is needed to determine the source of antimicrobial-resistant Enterococcus in free-living raptors but the limited data reflecting few differences between birds with and without antimicrobial exposure suggests that treatment and release of treated wild raptors is not contributing significantly to antimicrobial resistance in the environment. © Wildlife Disease Association 2009.},

abstract={For the purposes of making many informed conservation decisions, the main goal for data collection is to assess population status and allow prediction of the consequences of candidate management actions. Reducing the bias and variance of estimates of population parameters reduces uncertainty in population status and projections, thereby reducing the overall uncertainty under which a population manager must make a decision. In capture-recapture studies, imperfect detection of individuals, unobservable life-history states, local movement outside study areas, and tag loss can cause bias or precision problems with estimates of population parameters. Furthermore, excessive disturbance to individuals during capture-recapture sampling may be of concern because disturbance may have demographic consequences. We address these problems using as an example a monitoring program for Black-footed Albatross ( Phoebastria nigripes) and Laysan Albatross (Phoebastria immutabilis) nesting populations in the northwestern Hawaiian Islands. To mitigate these estimation problems, we describe a synergistic combination of sampling design and modeling approaches. Solutions include multiple capture periods per season and multistate, robust design statistical models, dead recoveries and incidental observations, telemetry and data loggers, buffer areas around study plots to neutralize the effect of local movements outside study plots, and double banding and statistical models that account for band loss. We also present a variation on the robust capture-recapture design and a corresponding statistical model that minimizes disturbance to individuals. For the albatross case study, this less invasive robust design was more time efficient and, when used in combination with a traditional robust design, reduced the standard error of detection probability by 14% with only two hours of additional effort in the field. These field techniques and associated modeling approaches are applicable to studies of most taxa being marked and in some cases have individually been applied to studies of birds, fish, herpetofauna, and mammals. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Migratory species are of increased conservation concern because of their reliance on multiple, geographically disjunct habitats. An understanding of how long-term ecological processes and contemporary population genetic patterns are related is critical for effective management and conservation of such species. Combining traditional long-term census and mark-recapture data with temporally focused molecular genetic data can help inform these efforts. We used 24 years of banding data, 15 years of migration counts, and molecular genetic data from 17 microsatellite loci to describe the migration phenology, direction, and population connectivity of Red-tailed Hawks (<italic>Buteo jamaicensis </italic>) migrating through the Marin Peninsula, California. Count data indicated two distinct peak periods of movement across years: 15 August-30 September and 1 October-30 November. Band-encounter data from these two periods revealed a significant difference in movement: individuals in the early period of migration (15 August-30 September) displayed little net movement, whereas individuals from the second period (1 October-30 November) showed directional, southward movement. Finally, molecular genetic data suggest that the early-season period primarily involves a population from central California, whereas the second period includes both individuals from central California and individuals from desert regions of the Intermountain West. These analyses provide important information for interpreting long-term Red-tailed Hawk count and banding data and offer an example of how traditional population-monitoring methods can be combined with molecular genetic markers. © 2009 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

Eleven juveniles died before leaving the nest (58%) and five survived for at least 9 days. Predation was the most common cause of mortality of young pipits both before and after fledging. Distances moved between days steadily increased but fledglings typically remained within 100 m of their nest during the first week post-fledging.

abstract={Lesser prairie-chickens Tympanuchus pallidicinctus have declined throughout their range because of loss or fragmen-tation of habitat from conversion of native prairie to agricultural cropland, exacerbated by overgrazing and drought. We used data from radio-marked lesser prairie-chickens to determine whether differences in survival ex-isted between populations occurring in two areas dominated by different vegetation types (sand sagebrush Artemisia filifolia vs shinnery oak Quercus havardii) in the Texas Panhandle from 2001 through 2005. We used a model-selec-tion approach to evaluate potential generalities in lesser prairie-chicken survival. Our results indicated that survival of lesser prairie-chickens differed between breeding and non-breeding periods, and between study populations. We estimated annual survival of lesser prairie-chickens at 0.52 (95% CI: 0.32-0.71) in the sand sagebrush and 0.31 (95% CI: 0.12-0.58) in the shinnery oak vegetation type. Our results suggest that demographic differences in lesser prairie-chicken within sand sagebrush and shinnery oak vegetation types throughout the Texas Panhandle should be eval-uated, especially during the breeding season. Based on our results, higher mortality of birds during the breeding season illustrates the need to manage for vegetation components such as sand sagebrush and residual bunchgrasses as opposed to shinnery oak such that potential breeding season mortality may be lessened. © Wildlife Biology.},

abstract={Information regarding survival and cause-specific mortality of eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) is vital to their management, especially in small or isolated populations. Between January 2003 and August 2005, we used radio telemetry to investigate survival and cause-specific mortality of 87 [44 male (24 adult and 20 juvenile) and 43 female (34 adult and 9 juvenile)] wild turkeys in northern Indiana. We estimated annual and seasonal survival using the Kaplan-Meier product-limit method. Mean male and female annual survival estimates were 0.257 and 0.777, respectively. Annual survival estimates were different between sexes within years, but were homogenous within sexes between years. Survival estimates did not differ among seasons for either sex. However, differences in survival estimates between sexes were detected in the spring, fall and winter seasons. Hunter harvest (46.2% male mortality) and predation (33.3% female mortality) were the leading known causes of mortality for male and female wild turkeys, respectively. Predators (canids, birds and unknown mammals) were responsible for 28.6% of mortality for both sexes combined. Although predation on adult birds was not severe, high mortality of male turkeys in the form of legal spring harvest, in addition to other causes of mortality, warrants concern for small, exploited populations in highly fragmented landscapes like those of northern Indiana.},

abstract={Events during the non-breeding season may affect the body condition of migratory birds and influence performance during the following breeding season. Migratory birds nesting in the Arctic often rely on endogenous nutrients for reproductive efforts, and are thus potentially subject to such carry-over effects. We tested whether king eider (Somateria spectabilis) arrival time and body mass upon arrival at breeding grounds in northern Alaska were affected by their choice of a winter region in the Bering Sea. We captured birds shortly after arrival on breeding grounds in early June 2002-2006 at two sites in northern Alaska and determined the region in which individuals wintered using satellite telemetry or stable isotope ratios of head feathers. We used generalized linear models to assess whether winter region explained variation in arrival body mass among individuals by accounting for sex, site, annual variation, and the date a bird was captured. We found no support for our hypothesis that either arrival time or arrival body mass of king eiders differed among winter regions. We conclude that wintering in different regions in the Bering Sea is unlikely to have reproductive consequences for king eiders in our study areas. © US Government 2009.},

abstract={Reduced pollination success, as a function of habitat loss and fragmentation, appears to be a global phenomenon. Disruption of pollinator movement is one hypothesis put forward to explain this pattern in pollen limitation. However, the small size of pollinators makes them very difficult to track; thus, knowledge of their movements is largely speculative. Using tiny radio transmitters (0.25 g), we translocated a generalist tropical 'trap-lining' hummingbird, the green hermit (Phaethornis guy), across agricultural and forested landscapes to test the hypothesis that movement is influenced by patterns of deforestation. Although, we found no difference in homing times between landscape types, return paths were on average 459±144 m (±s.e.) more direct in forested than agricultural landscapes. In addition, movement paths in agricultural landscapes contained 36±4 per cent more forest than the most direct route. Our findings suggest that this species can circumvent agricultural matrix to move among forest patches. Nevertheless, it is clear that movement of even a highly mobile species is strongly influenced by landscape disturbance. Maintaining landscape connectivity with forest corridors may be important for enhancing movement, and thus in facilitating pollen transfer. © 2009 The Royal Society.},

We tracked 190 king eiders with satellite transmitters between 1997 and 2007. In late summer, 74% of satellite-tracked king eiders migrating south staged in the ECS for 13 ± 13 (SD) days between late June and early November. During spring migration, king eiders staged in the ECS between mid-April and early June for 21 ± 10 days. All instrumented birds migrating to breeding grounds in western North America (n = 62), and 6 of 11 males migrating to breeding grounds in Siberia, used this area for at least 1 week during spring migration. The importance of this staging area renders it possible that industrial development could adversely affect king eider populations in both Siberia and North America. © 2009 US Government.},

abstract={Predicting broad-scale patterns of biodiversity is challenging, particularly in ecosystems where traditional methods of quantifying habitat structure fail to capture subtle but potentially important variation within habitat types. With the unprecedented rate at which global biodiversity is declining, there is a strong need for improvement in methods for discerning broad-scale differences in habitat quality. Here, we test the importance of habitat structure (i.e. fine-scale spatial variability in plant growth forms) and plant productivity (i.e. amount of green biomass) for predicting avian biodiversity. We used image texture (i.e. a surrogate for habitat structure) and vegetation indices (i.e., surrogates for plant productivity) derived from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data for predicting bird species richness patterns in the northern Chihuahuan Desert of New Mexico. Bird species richness was summarized for forty-two 108 ha plots in the McGregor Range of Fort Bliss Military Reserve between 1996 and 1998. Six Landsat TM bands and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to calculate first-order and second-order image textures measures. The relationship between bird species richness versus image texture and productivity (mean NDVI) was assessed using Bayesian model averaging. The predictive ability of the models was evaluated using leave-one-out cross-validation. Texture of NDVI predicted bird species richness better than texture of individual Landsat TM bands and accounted for up to 82.3% of the variability in species richness. Combining habitat structure and productivity measures accounted for up to 87.4% of the variability in bird species richness. Our results highlight that texture measures from Landsat TM imagery were useful for predicting patterns of bird species richness in semi-arid ecosystems and that image texture is a promising tool when assessing broad-scale patterns of biodiversity using remotely sensed data. © 2009 Ecography.},

abstract={Juvenile raptors often travel thousands of kilometers from the time they leave their natal areas to the time they enter a breeding population. Documenting movements and identifying areas used by raptors before they enter a breeding population is important for understanding the factors that influence their survival. In North America, juvenile Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus) are routinely observed outside the species' breeding range during the nonbreeding season, but the natal origins of these birds are rarely known. We used satellite telemetry to track the movements of juvenile Gyrfalcons during their first months of independence. We instrumented nestlings with lightweight satellite transmitters within 10 d of estimated fledging dates on the Seward Peninsula in western Alaska and in Denali National Park (Denali) in interior Alaska. Gyrfalcons spent an average of 41.4 ± 6.1 d (range = 30-50 d) in their natal areas after fledging. The mean departure date from natal areas was 27 August ± 6.4 d. We tracked 15 individuals for an average of 70.5 ± 28.1 d post-departure; Gyrfalcons moved from 105 to 4299 km during this period and tended to move greater distances earlier in the tracking period than later in the tracking period. Gyrfalcons did not establish temporary winter ranges within the tracking period. We identified several movement patterns among Gyrfalcons, including unidirectional long-distance movements, multidirectional long-and shortdistance movements, and shorter movements within a local region. Gyrfalcons from the Seward Peninsula remained in western Alaska or flew to eastern Russia with no movements into interior Alaska. In contrast, Gyrfalcons from Denali remained in interior Alaska, flew to northern and western Alaska, or flew to northern Alberta. Gyrfalcons from both study areas tended to move to coastal, riparian, and wetland areas during autumn and early winter. Because juvenile Gyrfalcons dispersed over a large geographic area and across three international boundaries, conservation efforts should focus on both regional and international scales. © 2009 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={A study, using satellite telemetry, was conducted to determine the precise migration patterns and wintering locations of Common Loons (Gavia immer) breeding in the northeastern United States. Transmitters were implanted in 17 loons (16 adults and one juvenile) that were captured on breeding lakes in New York, New Hampshire, and Maine during the summers of 2003, 2004, and 2005. Transmitters from ten of the birds provided adequate location data to document movement to wintering areas. Most adult loons appeared to travel non-stop from breeding lakes, or neighboring lakes (within 15 km), to the Atlantic coast. Adult loons marked in New Hampshire and Maine wintered 152 to 239 km from breeding lakes, along the Maine coast. Adult loons marked in the Adirondack Park of New York wintered along the coasts of Massachusetts (414 km from breeding lake), Rhode Island (362 km), and southern New Jersey (527 km). Most of the loons remained relatively stationary throughout the winter, but the size of individual wintering areas of adult loons ranged from 43 to 1,159 km 2, based on a 95% fixed kernel utilization distribution probability. A juvenile bird from New York made a number of stops at lakes and reservoirs en route to Long Island Sound (325 km from breeding lake). Maximum functional life of transmitters was about 12 months, providing an opportunity to document spring migration movements as well. This work provides essential information for development and implementation of regional Common Loon conservation strategies in the Northeastern U.S.},

Band recoveries occurred in 23 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces between 1931-2005. Recovery distance from the natal nest averaged longer for the youngest age classes (ANOVA: F = 3.59; df = 5,153;P = 0.005), for individuals banded in earlier decades (F= 1.94; df = 5,153;P = 0.093), and for the months of May through October (F= 3.10; df = 12,153; P< 0.001). Of 35 individuals classed as mature (≥3.9 yr old when recovered; range 3.9-36.5 yr), 31 were located within Florida, which suggested a strong degree of philopatry to the natal state. Among 21 mature eagles of known sex with known banding and recovery locations in Florida, females, particularly younger birds, had longer recovery distances (N = 9, mean = 93 km, SE = 22.4) than did males (N = 12, mean = 31 km, SE = 5.3; t = 2.67, df = 19, P = 0.026). The records examined here suggest a high degree of philopatry and relatively short natal dispersal distances, particularly in male Bald Eagles. © 2009 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Spray application of fluorescent particles is a widely used and very valuable technique for marking birds. This remains one of the few practical means to mark large numbers of birds for monitoring movement, despite recent availability of a variety of more technologically advanced options. We monitored the longevity of the DayGlo fluorescent particle marker on red-winged blackbirds under simulated field conditions in a flight pen, and in an observational field experiment. In the pen study we banded 52 red-winged blackbirds with individually numbered leg bands, and sprayed them with DayGlo fluorescent particle marker from a distance of ∼50cm, on 1 December 2004. These birds were recaptured and DayGlo fluorescent particle marks assessed 11 times until 10 August 2005. All 31 surviving birds at the conclusion of the study (i.e. after 254 days) retained at least some DayGlo fluorescent particle marker on one or more body regions. Wings retained DayGlo fluorescent particle marks longer than other body regions and thus could be used to identify marks in large-scale collections. Roosting wild blackbirds aerially marked in September and October 2005 retained marks through June 2006, 263 days after marking. The formulation used is inexpensive (US$4.00L-1), easy-to-apply at many scales and practical for many species (e.g. starlings, blackbirds, sparrows, gulls and shorebirds). © 2009 CSIRO.},

abstract={Infestations of bird blow flies (Protocalliphora spp. and Trypocalliphora braueri) have various negative effects on the condition of nestling birds. In the absence of other stressors such as inclement weather, however, infestation alone rarely reduces fledging success. Previous studies have documented effects of blow flies on nestling condition and fledging success. Without information regarding fledgling survival, the full effect of blow-fly infestation remains unclear. To fully investigate the effect of blow-fly infestation on reproductive success of the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla), we monitored infested and non-infested nests and monitored fledglings from each by using radio telemetry. Blow flies did not affect birds during the nestling period, as brood size, mean nestling mass, fledging success, and time to fledging in infested and non-infested nests were no different. Fledgling survival and minimum distance traveled the first day after fledging, however, were significantly lower for infected fledglings than for those that were not infected. We conclude that the stress of the early fledgling period combined with recent or concurrent blow-fly infection increases mortality in young Ovenbirds. Our results demonstrate the importance of including the post-fledging period in investigations of the effects of ectoparasitic infestations on birds. © 2009 by The Cooper Ornithological Society.

abstract={Relatively little is known about birds during the postfledging period when flighted chicks have left the nest and must learn to forage independently. We examined postfledging movements, habitat selection, and colony attendance of Forster's Terns (Sterna forsteri) radio-marked just before they fledged in San Francisco Bay, California. The proportion of the day spent at their natal colony declined as juveniles aged, from 65% at the time of fledging to &lt;5% within two weeks of fledging. Accordingly, the distance postfledging terns were located from their colony increased as they aged, from &lt;500 m within the first week of fledging to &gt;5000 m by their fifth week. Time of day also influenced colony attendance, with older terns spending more time at the colony during nighttime hours (20:00 to 05:00) than during the day (06:00 to 19:00), when they were presumably foraging. Home ranges and core-use areas averaged 12.14 km2 and 2.23 km2, respectively. At each of four spatial scales of analysis, postfledging terns selected salt pond habitats strongly. No other habitat types were selected at any scale, but terns consistently avoided tidal flats and uplands. Terns also avoided open bay habitats at the two largest spatial scales, tidal marsh habitats at the two smallest scales, and sloughs and managed marshes at several scales. Within salt ponds, terns were located closer to salt-pond levees (58 m) than was expected (107 m). Our results indicate that tern chicks disperse from their natal colony within a few weeks of fledging, with older chicks using their natal colony primarily for roosting during the night, and that postfledging terns are highly dependent on salt ponds. © 2009 by The Cooper Ornithological Society.

abstract={Weekly counts of western Atlantic red knots (Calidris canutus rufa) at their Delaware Bay migration stopover site have suggested a major decline since the 1980s. We estimated red knot spring passage population size in the New Jersey CoastDelaware Bay region (DENJ; 2004 and 2006) and Virginia (VA; 2006 and 2007), USA, by correcting weekly aerial counts for mean daily residence probability between counts in a Monte-Carlo simulation. We used daily telemetry relocations in markresight models to estimate mean daily residence probability. Average daily residence probability was approximately 1.0 in mid-May, 0.960.97 in the week of 22 May, and 0.640.77 after May 28 in DENJ in 2004 and 2006 and in VA in 2006. Average daily residency was approximately 0.88 in VA in 2007 from 22 May to 5 June. No birds moved from VA to DENJ in 2006 and only 2 birds (5.5) moved in 2007. Stopover population sizes (±SE) in DENJ were 17,108 ± 1,322 in 2004 and 19,555 ± 831 in 2006, and in VA were 7,224 ± 389 in 2006 and 8,332 ± 718 in 2007, significantly greater than peak aerial counts. Years with similar peak counts had different residence probabilities; hence, adjustments for turnover should be used in the future to assess annual population changes. Our results suggest that VA can support a significant portion of this red knot subspecies during migration in at least some years. Managing red knots for recovery should entail improving our understanding of the use of other Atlantic Coast sites and protecting key coastal habitat from disturbance and development. © The Wildlife Society.},

We collected 1,585 locations for 60 individuals (28 males, 32 females) during 23 May-2 August 2005 and 6 June-18 July 2006. Pooled data for both males and females, and both years resulted in mean 50 and 95% fixed kernel home range use distributions of 37.6 (n = 25) and 223.2 ha (n = 25) for all individuals with ≥30 locations. The mean maximum distance traveled between telemetry observations was 2,147.1 m (n = 28). There were no differences in home range size or mobility between male and female Least Bitterns, although there were great variations between years with birds in 2006 using home ranges five times larger than those in 2005. Habitat use was disproportionate to availability with birds using sites with cattail (Typha spp.) and arrowhead (Sagittaria spp.) to a greater extent than available in both 2005 and 2006. One of eight pairs monitored successfully reared young, while females of seven other pairs renested with new mates. Apparent nesting success was low due to severe weather events and nest depredation. We did not observe double brooding. Our study demonstrates that Least Bitterns are capable of using much larger home ranges than previously observed. © 2009 The Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={The ability to measure body composition is critical for studying the physiological ecology of animals. This is particularly true for small mammals that have a high metabolic rate. We evaluated a nondestructive method of body composition analysis that would allow accurate assessment of body fat, body water, and lean mass. We used total body electrical conductivity (TOBEC) to estimate body composition in the little brown myotis (Myotis lucifugus). In a sample of 46 individuals, TOBEC was both accurate and precise in estimating total body water and lean mass but was less effective at estimating total body fat. Mass-independent or whole-body compartments (i.e., total body water, total body fat, lean dry mass, and lean body mass) were more accurately estimated than mass-dependent or mass-specific body composition compartments (i.e., water content, fat index, and lean dry mass). The TOBEC measurements we made using an SA-3000 analyzer were influenced by extremes in body temperature, as well as by aluminum and incoloy wing bands. Our study also presents a new method of restraint especially suited for small mammals and birds that increases precision of TOBEC measurements. This study shows that TOBEC is a potentially valuable tool for studying changes in body composition of small mammals and may provide insight into the physiological impacts of various life history stages such as postnatal growth, reproduction, and hibernation. © 2009 The Wildlife Society.},

Predator trapping revealed the presence of both the black rat (Rattus rattus) and Norway rat (R. norvegicus) and that the density of rats was higher in broadleaf cloud forest than in nearby pine forest. Some thrushes that used cloud forest exclusively during the day roosted at night in adjacent pine habitat.

abstract={Translocations have been used for decades to restore or augment wildlife populations, yet more often than not, little to no data and/or arbitrary means are used for determining translocation success. The objectives of our study were to describe nesting habitat utilised by the greater sage grouse translocated into an extant population and to identify factors related to nest success, thereby demonstrating the adaptability of the birds to their new environment and producing one measure of long-term translocation success. We trapped female grouse individuals during the spring on and near leks of source populations, fitted them with radio-transmitters, and released them in the morning onto an active lek in an extant population in Strawberry Valley, Utah. We monitored translocated females for nesting activity and documented nesting attempts, nest success, clutch size and embryo viability. Data were recorded on habitat variables associated with nest sites and paired-random sites, including factors known to be important for resident females that nested successfully. We used logistic regression and an a priori information-theoretic approach for modelling nest v. paired-random sites and successful v. unsuccessful nest sites. Our analyses suggested that crown area of the nest shrub and percentage grass cover were the two variables that discriminated between nest and paired-random sites. Females that nested successfully selected sites with more total shrub canopy cover, intermediate size-shrub crown area, aspects other than NW and SE, and steeper slopes than for unsuccessful nests. After being translocated from distant sites with differing habitat characteristics, these birds were able to initiate a nest, nest successfully, and select micro-habitat features similar to those selected by resident sage grouse across the species range. Our results demonstrate the adaptability of the translocated female sage grouse individuals and produce one tangible measure of long-term translocation success. © 2009 CSIRO.},

abstract={Dispersal distances determine the scales over which many population processes occur. Knowledge of these distances may therefore be crucial in determining the appropriate spatial scales for research and management. However, dispersal distances are difficult to measure, especially for vagile organisms like songbirds. For these species, the use of traditional mark-recapture and radio-telemetry methods is problematic. We used positive one-year time-lagged correlations in abundance to estimate natal dispersal distances. Using the North American Breeding Bird Survey database, we examined one-year time-lagged correlations between pairs of North American songbird samples separated by 10-100 km. We submit that consistent positive one-year time-lagged correlations reflect the exchange of individuals through dispersal. We found positive one-year time-lagged correlations between pairs of samples from 25 different songbird species. The median distances of these correlations ranged from 15 to 95 km, depending on the species. These distances were positively correlated with body size and wing length. Dispersal appears to be the most parsimonious explanation for the time-lagged correlations we observed in these species. The putative dispersal distances we measured are generally an order of magnitude longer than those reported in the literature. © 2009 Ecography.},

abstract={Higher predation on birds' nests is often associated with habitat fragmentation and edges, but little research has addressed whether these predation patterns result from non-random habitat use by predators. Using 2 endangered bird species, black-capped vireo (Vireo atricapilla) and golden-cheeked warbler (Dendroica chrysoparia), and their primary nest predator, the Texas ratsnake (Elaphe obsoleta), we test the hypothesis that birds nesting in habitats preferred by ratsnakes suffer higher nest predation than those nesting in non-preferred habitats. Ratsnakes did not use their habitat randomly, instead preferring locations with more structure and closer to cover objects and edges. Despite large sample sizes (186 nests and 31 snakes with radio transmitters), however, we did not find clear relationships between snake habitat preference and avian nest survival. Our results, in conjunction with those of another study, suggest that warbler nests were at greater risk if edge was abundant near the nest. Thus, reducing edge could promote nest survival. Additionally, because ratsnakes preferred warbler habitat over vireo habitat, vireos might suffer less predation in larger habitat patches that would increase average distances of nests from the snakes' preferred habitat. In making one bird species' habitat less attractive to ratsnakes' however, we may increase snake predation on other species.},

abstract={Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations have been declining throughout their range, but some of the sharpest declines have been documented in the Mid-Atlantic states. We conducted a 2 year (2006-2007) breeding season (1 May-30 Sep) telemetry study in southern New Jersey to collect baseline data on Northern Bobwhite reproductive rates, and nest and brood microhabitat selection. We located 23 Northern Bobwhite nests, of which 21 were usable for survival analyses. Incubation-period nest survival rate was 0.454 ± 0.010 (95 CI =0.2800.727). Mean clutch size was 14.2 ± 0.58 (range 10-19, n = 20) and hatching success was 96.1 ± 2.0 (range 86-100%, n = 10). The estimated probability that an individual that entered the breeding season would initiate incubation of ≥1 nest was 0.687 for females and 0.202 for males. Nest microhabitat selection was positively related to visual obstruction and percentage of litter. Brood microhabitat selection was positively related to visual obstruction, vegetation height, and percentage of forbs but negatively related to percentage of cool season grass and litter. Fecundity metrics for Northern Bobwhites in southern New Jersey appear similar to those reported elsewhere in the species' range. Conservation efforts to increase Northern Bobwhite reproductive success in southern New Jersey should focus on increasing the quantity of available breeding habitat. © 2009 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Somateria mollissima (Common Eider) is an important game species throughout its circumpolar range, including eastern Canada and northeastern United States. In eastern Canada, the largest harvest of Common Eiders occurs in Newfoundland; however, the age, sex, and subspecific composition (S. m. borealis and dresseri are both present) of this hunted population is not well quantified. The species, subspecies, age, and sex composition of the harvest was determined by examining heads collected from 1672 eiders (including Somateria spectabilis [King Eider]), taken mostly by hunters, from 1980-1996. Band-recovery information for Common Eiders banded in Newfoundland and Labrador were also summarized, including data from a release program of hand-reared ducklings in northern Newfoundland from 1988-1996. The composition of the eider harvest varied across the province. In northern and eastern areas, borealis Common Eiders made up the bulk of the harvest. King Eiders were also taken in these areas. In southern areas, most Common Eiders taken were dresseri. Sex ratios tend to be near 1:1, and immature birds comprised most of the harvest. Recovery distributions showed that Common Eiders breeding in Newfoundland and Labrador were mainly taken within the province, but also contributed to harvests in Qubec and Nova Scotia, and to a lesser extent, Maine. Hand-reared ducklings had direct recovery rates of 0.047 and were most likely to be recovered within the province in the year of banding, but contributed to harvests in Atlantic Canada and New England as they aged. The harvest of eiders in Newfoundland varies regionally and seasonally; therefore specific harvest regulations could be implemented to manage the variety of populations present in the province throughout the year.},

abstract={We studied the populations of birds breeding on Prince Charles Island and Air Force Island, Foxe Basin, Nunavut, to determine whether the islands should be protected as a National Wildlife Area. In 1996 and 1997, we classifi ed the habitats found on the islands and we determined the numbers and breeding status of birds on 85 survey plots on the islands. Shorebird species diversity and densities were compared to results from published studies carried out elsewhere in the Arctic and to results of shorebird surveys carried out on Prince Charles Island 8 years previously. We also did aerial surveys on both islands to look for waterfowl and Sabine's Gulls Xema sabini, and we compared those results with information collected from aerial surveys 12 years previously. We observed 42 species of birds on the islands and confi rmed that 25 of the 42 species were nesting on the islands. Red Phalaropes Phalaropus fulicarius, White-rumped Sandpipers Calidris fuscicollis, and Ruddy Turnstone Arenaria interpres morinella were the most common of the 12 shorebird species recorded. Other breeders were American Golden-Plover Pluvialis dominica, Blackbellied Plover Pluvialis squatarola, Dunlin Calidris alpina hudsonia, and Semipalmated Sandpiper Calidris pusilla. Pectoral Sandpipers Calidris melanotos, Baird's Sandpipers Calidris bairdii, and Semipalmated Plovers Charadrius semipalmatus probably breed but we did not confi rm this. Red Knot Calidris canutus rufa and Purple Sandpipers Calidris maritima maritima were observed but, because no breeding behaviour was observed, we assumed that they were migrants. On Prince Charles Island the best shorebird habitat-wet vegetated graminoid (sedge/grass) tundra-is distributed in a thick band around the outside of the island. The interior of the island is mostly dry and barren. Air Force Island is nearly completely wet vegetated graminoid tundra. Shorebirds were not distributed equally among habitat types. White-rumped Sandpipers and Red Phalaropes seemed to choose from among the various wet habitat types, and they preferred sedge marsh to other wet habitat types. Prince Charles Island and Air Force Island are major breeding sites for shorebirds. The islands together contain an estimated 272 470 pairs of shorebirds and an estimated 626 045 individuals. The population estimates for eight bird species are greater than 1% of the current North American population estimate. With the Great Plains of the Koukdjuak (West Baffi n Island), Prince Charles Island and Air Force Island are the most important known breeding sites for Red Phalaropes and White-rumped Sandpipers in the entire Canadian Arctic. The numbers and distribution of both shorebird and other bird species have changed over time. The populations of three shorebird species clearly changed on Prince Charles Island between 1989 and 1997: Dunlin increased, and Red Phalaropes and White-rumped Sandpipers both decreased. Between 1984 and 1997, the population size and the extent of the distribution of Lesser Snow Geese Chen caerulescens caerulescens increased on Air Force Island, and the population size and the extent of the distribution of Atlantic Brant Branta bernicla hrota decreased. Sabine's Gull decreased over the same period of time on Prince Charles Island. Prince Charles Island and Air Force Island are extremely important to Black-bellied Plovers, American Golden-Plovers, Ruddy Turnstones ssp. morinella, Whiterumped Sandpipers, Dunlin ssp. hudsonia, Red Phalaropes, Purple Sandpipers Calidris maritima maritima, Red Knot ssp. rufa, Sabine's Gull, Atlantic Brant, and Long-tailed Jaegers Stercorarius longicaudus. The islands meet the criteria to be designated a National Wildlife Area, and we recommend that they be protected under the Canada Wildlife Act regulations for National Wildlife Areas.

abstract={Banding penguins is controversial because bands can alter the survival, reproduction, and behavior of marked individuals. The effects of bands are not consistent among band types and, although stainless steel is thought to be better than other materials, tests of the long-term impact of bands on tag-loss rates and the reproduction and survival of individuals are needed. We tested three types of external tags on Magellanic Penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) to measure band effects and tag-loss rates. In 1993, we double-tagged 300 penguins with aluminum flipper bands, stainless-steel flipper bands, or small (2 mm × 10 mm) metal tags attached to foot webbing. We searched for double-tagged birds for 13 of 15 yrs (1994-2008). Aluminum bands deformed, caused feather wear, injured and killed some penguins, and were lost more often than stainless-steel bands or web tags. During the first 2 yrs of our study, at least nine penguins lost one aluminum band (N = 71 penguins resighted), but no penguins lost a stainless-steel band (N = 84) or a web tag (N = 88). During the next 13 yrs, five penguins lost one of their two web tags (N = 89), but none lost a stainless-steel band (N = 84). Females laid eggs of similar size before they carried a band and in the year following tagging (P = 0.09). The type of tags a female carried did not significantly change egg size (P > 0.22). During the first breeding season after tagging, penguins with aluminum bands had lower reproductive success than penguins with stainless-steel bands or web-tags (P = 0.04). The annual survival of females with two stainless-steel bands was lower (0.79) than that of males with two stainless-steel bands or males and females with two web-tags (0.87). Aluminum bands injured Magellanic Penguins, were lost at high rates, and should not be used. Double stainless-steel bands had no apparent effects on adult male Magellanic Penguins, but reduced survival rates of adult females. A single stainless-steel band would likely have less impact than two bands, and our results suggest that the impact of a single band would be difficult to measure. ©2010 The Author(s).

abstract={Although investigators have compared radio-transmitter attachment devices and their likelihood of failure before the end of a study, few have directly evaluated the harness materials and fastening methods that are to be shed by a bird after the research period is over. We compared the likelihood of effective detachment after transmitter life of four harness materials (7-mm- and 9-mm-wide polyester ribbon tape and polyester-coated rubber elastic) and three fastening methods (polyester thread, cotton thread, and Gorilla Super Glue™) using dummy transmitters exposed to the elements for >1.5 years. Both polyester ribbon and polyester-coated rubber elastic materials resulted in similar physical wear and remained intact for longer than a typical field seasonal, but fastening harnesses using Gorilla Super Glue™ resulted in the earliest and most consistent harness failure. Polyester ribbon material and glue fastening resulted in the earliest failure; mean failure time for 7-mm- and 9-mm-wide polyester ribbon tape with glue fastening was 408 days ± 30 SE, and 249 days ± 29 SE, respectively. Failure times for both 7-mm- and 9-mm-wide polyester-coated rubber elastic and Gorilla Super Glue™ fastening treatments were in excess of one year (438 days ± 14 SE and 438 days ± 13 SE, respectively). All harnesses with sewn thread fastening treatments lasted a minimum mean of 456 days, and in the case of both 7-mm-wide polyester ribbon and polyester-coated rubber elastic, neither treatment ever failed over the period of study. Results suggest that using Gorilla Super Glue™ as a fastener maximized the likelihood of eventual harness failure, whereas transmitters fastened via sewing showed minimal signs of wear and were unlikely to be shed by a bird during a period of time less than two years. Additional experimental studies are warranted to examine alternative harness material types, fastening methods, and harness styles to maximize the potential of successful radio transmitter shedding.},

abstract={Male songbirds often move off-territory to pursue extra-pair fertilizations. This movement represents a trade-off between paternity gain and loss and can be influenced by male quality and access to fertile females. Access to females could be reduced in fragmented landscapes that have small patches and low connectedness. We studied movement and extra-pair fertilization success of radio-tracked male American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) in forest patches in an agricultural landscape in Alberta, Canada, over 2 years. Males spent an average of 18% of their time off-territory, mostly intruding onto adjacent territories and rarely moving between patches. They averaged 0.8 trips/h, with mean trip duration of 17 min and mean trip distance of 104 m. Less time was spent off-territory when their mate was nest-building and males intruded most often onto territories with nest-building females. Males with higher song rates and more nearby females intruded most onto other territories. Monogamous males in better condition with higher song rates spent the most time off-territory. However, males with more nearby females and higher local breeding synchrony spent the least time off-territory, suggesting these males face a trade-off between seeking extra-pair fertilizations and protecting against cuckoldry. Forest cover was not an important predictor of movement. Investment in off-territory movement did not predict extra-pair fertilization success or probability of cuckoldry. However, few tracked males achieved extra-pair fertilizations (1/22 tracked males vs 18/57 non-tracked males), possibly an artefact of low sample size or the effect of radio transmitters on female choice. © Dt.

abstract={Avian botulism outbreaks are frequently perpetuated by type C toxin produced by Clostridium botulinum proliferating in decomposing bird carcasses and consumption of toxic maggots from these carcasses by healthy birds. Therefore, removing bird carcasses has been advocated for disease management because availability of toxic maggots should be reduced, increasing duck survival. However, this management is expensive, and its effect on waterfowl mortality under field conditions is unknown. We radio-marked 419 molting mallards on 11 lakes in western Canada during July-August 1999-2001 and monitored them for 30 days, testing whether survival was higher on lakes with carcass removal. Botulism occurred on 10 lakes. On five carcass removal lakes, greater-than-normal effort was made to conduct early, thorough surveillance and immediately remove carcasses; on six nonremoval lakes, no carcasses were removed. In 1999, estimated 30-day survival probabilities ranged from 0.149 (95% CI=0.065-0.304) on one large lake with carcass removal to 0.466 (95% CI=0.270-0.674) and 0.618 (95% CI=0.443-0.767) on two nonremoval lakes. As a result, we conducted work on smaller wetlands thereafter, reasoning that any management benefit would be easier to detect. In 2000, estimated 30-day survival probabilities were 0.313 (95% CI=0.143-0.556) and 0.794 (95% CI=0.609-0.905) on two carcass removal lakes versus 0.525 (95% CI=0.362-0.682) and 0.743 (95% CI=0.564-0.866) on two nonremoval lakes. In 2001, botulism was detected on two nonremoval lakes where survival probabilities were 0.845 (95% CI=0.630-0.946) and 0.942 (95% CI=0.778-0.987), and on one removal lake where survival probability was 1.0 (95% CI=0.99-1.0), but not detected on the other removal lake where no marked birds died from botulism (1.0, 95% CI=0.99-1.0). Survival tended to be higher on lakes with lower carcass density, but when data were organized by carcass removal versus nonremoval, mallard survival was not consistently greater on lakes where carcasses were removed. © Wildlife Disease Association 2010.},

abstract={Clark's Nutcrackers (Nucifraga columbiana) disperse seeds of whitebark pines (Pinus albicaulis) in western North America by their scatter-hoarding behavior. Because of declines in whitebark pine, resource managers are seeking an effective means of monitoring nutcracker population trends and the probability of seed dispersal by nutcrackers. We tested the reliability of four survey techniques (standard point counts, playback point counts, line transects, and Breeding Bird Survey routes) for estimating population size by conducting surveys at sites where a portion of the nutcracker population was marked with radio transmitters. The efficacy of distance sampling, based on detection rates from our unadjusted surveys, was also assessed. We conducted counts of whitebark pine cones within stands and related the probability of seed dispersal within stands to cone production and nutcracker abundance. We conducted 70 h of surveys for Clark's Nutcrackers at eight sites from July through November in 2007 and 2009 and estimated cone densities at six of these sites. Detection rates for all survey techniques were low and variable and we detected an average of 5.6 nutcrackers per 30 min of survey time. We also found no difference in detection rates among survey types, although significantly more nutcrackers were detected during surveys conducted during the peak of whitebark pine cone harvest (P < 0.0001). Nutcracker abundance was not correlated with cone density (P= 0.29) and we observed nutcrackers pouching seeds at all sites. Thus, cone density did not provide reliable information on whether seed dispersal was likely to occur. We suggest that alternate methods be considered for monitoring populations and assessing seed dispersal probability because we did not reliably detect nutcrackers using conventional survey techniques and because nutcracker abundance was not correlated with cone density.

abstract={Barrow's Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica) are secondary cavity nesters found in western North America and, to a lesser extent, in eastern North America. The eastern North American population is concentrated in the province of Québec and totals about 2000 pairs. Characteristics of nest cavities used by Barrow's Goldeneyes have been described in western North America, but no nest cavities have been found in eastern North America. From 2004 to 2008, we searched for nest cavities in the species' core breeding area in the boreal forests north of the St. Lawrence River. We captured 12 adult females on their breeding grounds and fitted them with transmitters, but none apparently nested so we conducted ground searches in areas near lakes where paired birds were observed. We found 11 cavities, with 10 in dead, decaying trees and one in the dead part of a dying tree. Nine cavities were in white birch (Betula papyrifera) trees. Mean cavity height was 3.5 ± 1.6 (SD) m (range = 1.2-6.6 m) and mean diameter at breast height (DBH) of cavity trees was 37.8 ± 4.7 cm (range = 32.2-47.5 cm). In contrast to the population in western North America, Barrow's Goldeneyes in eastern North America appear to rely on the availability of natural cavities formed in large, decaying trees for nesting. Current forestry regulations in Québec do not promote the retention of either large trees or older forests, reducing the availability of potential nest cavities for Barrow's Goldeneyes and likely threatening their long-term conservation. Therefore, we recommend that guidelines be developed to promote silvicultural practices aimed at preserving the long-term availability of large (DBH ≥ 30 cm) decaying trees across the breeding range of Barrow's Goldeneyes. © 2010 Her Majesty The Queen (Canada).},

abstract={Local and migratory movements aloft have important implications for the ecology and conservation of birds, but are difficult to quantify. Weather surveillance radar (WSR) offers a unique tool for observing movements of birds, but until now has been used primarily to address broad taxonomic questions. Herein, we demonstrate how natural history information and ground-truthing can be used to answer quantitative and taxon-specific questions regarding bird movements on WSR. We found that super-resolution Level II data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's mass storage system was the most effective format and source of WSR data, and that several software packages were needed for thorough analysis of WSR data. Using WSR, we identified potential movements of birds emigrating from a waterfowl stopover area in Illinois in fall (1 September-31 December) 2006 and 2007. We compared spatial and temporal patterns of these movements to the natural history of taxa occupying the source habitat and classified these radar targets as dabbling ducks (tribe Anatini). A portable X-band radar measured the cruising heights of ducks at 400-600 m. During fall 2008, we conducted ground-truthing with a thermal infrared camera to enumerate birds passing over our field site during nocturnal migration events. This estimate of bird density, paired with an associated sample of WSR echo strength, provided a mean radar cross section the same as dabbling ducks (112.5 cm2) and supported our natural-history-based classification. Thermal infrared-estimated duck densities explained most of the variation(R2= 0.91) in WSR echo strength across seven migration events of varying intensities, suggesting that radar cross sections of dabbling ducks and WSR reflectivity can be used to estimate duck numbers in other comparable contexts. Our results suggest that careful investigation of the spatial and temporal patterns of movements on radar, along with field-based ground-truthing, can be used to study and quantify the movements of specific bird taxa. ©2010 The Author(s).

abstract={Long-distance migration between nonbreeding and breeding grounds involves use of multiple stopover sites where birds must refuel to meet the energetic demands of migration. Migrant forest birds that encounter urban landscapes experience high levels of habitat fragmentation and often use small, isolated forest patches. we investigated factors influencing stopover duration (length of stay) and migratory departure of Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) using forest patches within an urban landscape in Columbus, Ohio. During May, 2004-2007, we fitted 69 Swainson's Thrushes with 0.66-g radio transmitters, experimentally relocated the birds to seven mature forest sites that varied in area and degree of urbanization and monitored each individual daily until it departed. Mean minimum stopover duration was 3.7 days (± 3.4 SD), ranging from 1 to 12 days. Stopover duration was negatively related to advancement of migration (Julian date) and energetic condition at capture, and departure from stopover sites was associated with low wind speed and declining barometric pressure. we found no difference in stopover duration across the seven urban sites despite large variation in forest area and degree of urbanization. Swainson's Thrushes had strong site tenacity at the five largest (11.9-38.4 ha) sites, where 100% of birds remained until migratory departure; in contrast, 28% of individuals left the smallest (0.7 and 4.5 ha) sites during stopover. Results suggest that patches of remnant forest within cities may provide Swainson's Thrushes with suitable stopover opportunities without strongly influencing their migratory schedule, but minimum area requirements may limit the thrushes' use of some patches. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2010.},

abstract={Management of Pacific Flyway Canada geese (Branta canadensis) requires information on winter distribution of different populations. Recoveries of tarsus bands from Vancouver Canada geese (B. canadensis fulva) marked in southeast Alaska, USA, ≥4 decades ago suggested that ≥83% of the population was non-migratory and that annual adult survival was high (Ŝ = 0.836). However, recovery distribution of tarsus bands was potentially biased due to geographic differences in harvest intensity in the Pacific Flyway. Also, winter distribution of Vancouver Canada geese could have shifted since the 1960s, as has occurred for some other populations of Canada geese. Because winter distribution and annual survival of this population had not recently been evaluated, we surgically implanted very high frequency radiotransmitters in 166 adult female Canada geese in southeast Alaska. We captured Vancouver Canada geese during molt at 2 sites where adults with goslings were present (breeding areas) and 2 sites where we observed nonbreeding birds only. During winter radiotracking flights in southeast Alaska, we detected 98% of 85 females marked at breeding areas and 83% of 70 females marked at nonbreeding sites, excluding 11 females that died prior to the onset of winter radiotracking. We detected no radiomarked females in coastal British Columbia, or western Washington and Oregon, USA. Most (70%) females moved ≤30 km between November and March. Our model-averaged estimate of annual survival (Ŝ = 0.844, SE = 0.050) was similar to the estimate of annual survival of geese marked from 1956 to 1960. Likely <2% of Vancouver Canada geese that nest in southeast Alaska migrate to winter areas in Oregon or Washington where they could intermix with Canada geese from other populations in the Pacific Flyway. Because annual survival of adult Vancouver Canada geese was high and showed evidence of long-term consistency, managers should examine how reproductive success and recruitment may affect the population. © The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={In 1993, a mark-recapture effort was initiated to band annually all Great Lakes Piping Plover nesting adults and offspring. With voluntary reporting by observers, >430 sightings of 154 individually-marked Great Lakes banded birds were documented on the wintering grounds during 19952005. This paper reports non-breeding distribution and site-fidelity and identifies Critical Habitat units used by this population during the winter. Information obtained through banded bird sightings indicates that the winter range of Great Lakes Piping Plovers extends from North Carolina to Texas, and the Bahamas, with the majority (75%) of reported individuals wintering in Georgia and Florida. About 95% of sightings were near or within federally-designated winter Critical Habitat for Piping Plovers. Within season (52%) and between-year (62%) site fidelity was documented for resightings within 3.5 km of initial sighting. Although breeding pairs do not winter in close association, there is some evidence to suggest that offspring winter closer to the male rather than the female parent (P-value = 0.03), and adult males and females appear to exhibit latitudinal segregation (P-value < 0.001). Females reach the winter grounds before males, arriving in July and staying through April (∼9 months) or 75% of the annual cycle. The study is the first to identify winter distribution for the Great Lakes Piping Plover population. The significant proportion of the annual cycle spent on the wintering grounds emphasizes the importance of habitat protection during the non-breeding season for this federally-listed population.},

abstract={Implanted transmitters have become an important tool for studying the ecology of sea ducks, but their effects remain largely undocumented. To address this, we assessed how abdominally implanted transmitters with percutaneous antennas affect the vertical dive speeds, stroke frequencies, bottom time, and dive duration of captive Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima). To establish baselines, we recorded video of six birds diving 4.9 m prior to surgery, implanted them with 38-to 47-g platform transmitter terminals, and then recorded their diving for 3.5 months after surgery to determine effects. Descent speeds were 16-25% slower and ascent speeds were 17-44% slower after surgery, and both remained below baseline at the end of the study. Dive durations were longer than baseline until day 22. On most days between 15 and 107 days after surgery, foot-stroke frequencies of birds foraging on the bottom were slower. foot-and wing-stroke frequencies during descent and bottom time did not differ across the time series. If birds that rely on benthic invertebrates for sustenance dive slower and stay submerged longer after being implanted with a satellite transmitter, their foraging energetics may be affected. Researchers considering use of implanted transmitters with percutaneous antennas should be mindful of these effects and the possibility of concomitant alterations in diving behavior, foraging success, and migratory behavior compared to those of unmarked conspecifics. ©.

abstract={Unlike other North American prairie-nesting dabbling ducks, northern pintail (Anas acuta) populations have not increased since the early 1990s and remain well below the long-term average for traditional survey areas. Previously reported estimates of annual survival and recovery rates for pintails did not investigate any spatial or temporal factors to explain annual variation of these rates. We used band-recovery data from 1970 to 2003 to test the influence of temporal periods defined by differing harvest regulations and habitat conditions of breeding grounds with spatially delineated regions on survival and recovery rates of northern pintails in North America. We separated regions based on a multiresponse permutation procedure to identify banding blocks with dissimilar recovery distributions based on a cluster analysis. We categorized time by grouping years into temporal periods based on bag limits, season lengths, or overflight versus nonoverflight years. We used the Brownie approach in Program MARK to evaluate 46 a priori models estimating survival and recovery rates. The best approximating model indicated that survival varied with age, sex, and region with additive time and interactive time-by-age and time-by-region effects. Recovery rate was best represented by a fully interactive term comprised of age, sex, region, and year. There were no statistical differences among average annual survival point estimates between age and sex classes within each region, and our estimates were similar to previous unpublished studies. We found the eastern region had decreased survival and increased recovery rates compared to other regions. Trends in pintail survival suggest that variation in annual survival was not the cause of the initial decrease in the northern pintail population and is unlikely the dominant factor preventing the population from increasing. The influence of other population parameters, such as recruitment rate, should be investigated to further evaluate other causes for the population status of northern pintails. Use of the top-ranked model to estimate annual survival and recovery rates for northern pintails in North America, which indicated that annually varying estimates of survival rates were better supported by the data than grouping years into temporal classes (i.e., based on bag limits, season lengths, and overflight yr) can be used by managers and policy makers when considering annual harvest regulations and effects of conservation efforts. Managers should incorporate these estimates into future demographic studies of pintails as well as consider using the top-ranked model for future analyses of band-recovery data. © The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Wildlife telemetry research has expanded greatly in the last 2 decades, with the application of satellite tracking and archival logging technologies to study the ecology and conservation of marine mammals, birds, fishes, and turtles. Widespread and expanding use of satellite tracking to study movements and habitats of marine megavertebrates warrants a review of progress to date and a discussion of challenges facing this rapidly evolving research field. To this end, we reviewed the satellite telemetry literature of air-breathing marine taxa (i.e. birds, mammals, turtles) over the 20 yr time period from 1987 to 2006. This review yielded 92 studies with a wide taxonomic representation: 47 seabirds, 23 sea turtles, and 22 marine mammals. Here we critically evaluate these articles to assess progress in satellite tracking of marine megavertebrates in terms of (1) objectives and approach, (2) experimental design, and (3) reporting of results. The overall trends revealed increases in the duration and scope of tracking studies, yet improvements on experimental design and reporting are needed to facilitate comparisons across studies and species. While inherent ecological differences influence the focus and methods of taxon-specific studies, this review highlights specific areas in need of improvement and provides general suggestions for future tracking studies of marine megavertebrates. © Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract={Understanding how home range size varies across seasons can provide insights into how birds respond to changes In resource levels. Yet, seasonal variation in home range size of most Neotropical birds is poorly understood. We recorded locations of color-banded Tropical Kingbirds during four years at a site comprised of cerrado woodland, humid forest, and cattle pasture in the southern Amazon Basin. We found no significant difference in the mean home range size of males (43.0 ± 22.6 ha) and females (45.6 ± 45.5 ha). Although kingbirds had smaller home ranges in the non-breeding season than In the breeding season, differences in home range size were not significant between seasons. We radiotracked nine kingbirds and compared their home range size to that of color-banded birds without radio transmitters. We found no significant difference in the mean home range size of kingbirds determined by telemetry data (41.8 ± 24.0 ha) and those determined by observations of color-banded individuals (43.4 ± 36.3 ha), suggesting that both methods of estimating home range size are roughly equivalent.

abstract={Fledgling birds are notoriously difficult to find and capture because of their cryptic behavior. As a result, researchers usually affix transmitters to nestlings to study aspects of post-fledging ecology. However, parents may attempt to remove nestling transmitters, which could negatively impact nestlings. We attached radio-transmitters to 95 Sprague's Pipit (Anthus spragueii) nestlings using a modified Rappole and Tipton leg harness. Within 1-2 days after transmitter attachment, we recorded six cases of parents removing transmitters from nestlings and depositing the transmitters outside the nest. At one of these nests, we videotaped parents pecking and pulling at nestlings that had transmitters and also dragging a nestling out of the nest by the transmitter. Of 12 video-monitored nests where we attached transmitters to nestlings, 33% had cases of parents attempting to remove transmitters by pecking and pulling at nestlings. Our observations highlight the need to closely monitor nestlings with transmitters so that researchers have the opportunity to reattach transmitters should parents remove them and to monitor the health of nestlings. Video-monitoring nests could also help to identify any unseen, negative impacts on nestlings due to transmitter attachment. © 2010 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.},

abstract={Loss and modification of tidal marsh habitat has contributed to the decline of marsh bird species. For many marsh birds that inhabit tidal ecosystems, little information exists on habitat use, particularly in relation to movement and response to prey availability. In this study, radio-telemetry was used to investigate home range size, movement patterns and response of Clapper Rails (Rallus longirostris) to prey availability within tidal marshes in coastal Mississippi. Mean fixed kernel 95% home range for breeding Clapper Rails was 1.37 ha ± SE 0.27 (N = 10 birds) with a 50% core use area 0.32 ha ± SE 0.07 (N = 10 birds), which are estimates similar to those obtained throughout this species' range. The extent of Clapper Rail movements during the incubation period was negatively correlated with density of fiddler crab burrows within 50 m of nest sites. Clapper Rails' use of marsh edge decreased relative to tidal height. Use of this habitat type may have been further restricted during the first few weeks of the parental-care period when adults were caring for recently fledged young. Collectively these results illustrate the importance of edge and interior marsh habitats and may provide an explanation for the variation in Clapper Rail densities found within and between tidal marsh systems.},

abstract={Avian captive breeding programs pose a particular challenge with migratory birds due to natal dispersal and high mortality during migration. In Canada a captive breeding program for the eastern loggerhead shrike (Lanius ludovicianus migrans) has released over 400 juveniles since 2001, but the fate of almost all these birds is unknown. In 2007 and 2008, we used radio-telemetry of captive-reared juveniles to determine pre-migration survival and dispersal movements away from the release site. Overall, 76% (29 of 38) of shrikes survived from release to the initiation of migration and the daily survival rate was 0.987. Most deaths (78%) occurred in females, suggesting a possible sex-biased pre-migration mortality. Shrikes typically dispersed independently, there was little overlap between dispersal sites, and the average pre-migration dispersal distance from the release site was 4.2. km (SD 2.4). Release date was negatively correlated with time spent at the release site prior to dispersal, but did not have a significant effect on survival, time spent at dispersal sites or distance of dispersal. Migration initiation date ranged over 6. weeks and early-hatched juveniles were the first to begin migration. Using aerial telemetry, we located five of 29 birds that had begun migration at distances up to 180. km from the release site; no birds were found dead after initiating migration despite the extensive search area. High juvenile survival to migration for captive-reared juveniles suggests that the captive breeding and release program has high potential to augment wild populations of the eastern loggerhead shrike. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={The post-fledging period represents a time of considerable energetic constraint and selection pressure for juvenile songbirds. Despite its potential importance for survival, this period remains one of the least studied stages of the annual cycle. Using radio telemetry and taking advantage of unique topographical characteristics at three spatially separated study sites, we assessed four hypotheses regarding the function of broad-scale, landscape-level movements for juveniles: (1) commencement of migration, (2) habitat optimization, (3) selection of a breeding territory, and (4) formation of a homing target. For the Blackpoll Warbler (D. striata), we found that movement was directed to the southeast at all three study sites but individuals were also associated with river valleys, providing support for the homing-target and habitat-optimization hypotheses. For the Yellow-rumped Warbler (Dendroica coronata), we found that movement was directed toward and down river valleys, following the unique orientation of the valleys at each study site, supporting the habitat-optimization hypothesis. Our results provide important insights into the function of broad-scale landscape-level movements for juvenile songbirds prior to migration, as well as their relative importance to individuals' success, both immediate and future. © 2010 The Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={The Black Oystercatcher (Haematopus bachmani) is an intertidal obligate along North America's Pacific coast and a species of high conservation concern (population size 8900-11 000 individuals). Understanding birds' movements and space use throughout the annual cycle has become paramount in the face of changing environmental conditions, and intertidal species may be particularly vulnerable to habitat change due to anticipated sea-level rise associated with climate change and increasing coastal development. Conservation of the Black Oystercatcher is hindered by a lack of information on the species' nonbreeding distribution, seasonal movements, and habitat connectivity. Using satellite (n = 19) and VHF (n = 19) radio transmitters, we tracked Black Oystercatchers from five breeding sites (Vancouver Island, British Columbia; Kodiak Island, Prince William Sound, Middleton Island, and Juneau, Alaska) through one and one half annual cycles (May 2007-Dec 2008). We documented medium- to long-distance migration (range of migration distance 130-1667 km) in three populations (Prince William Sound, Middleton Island, and Juneau) and year-round residency in two others (Kodiak and Vancouver Island). We observed variation in the timing and length of migration by study site, and individual birds demonstrated fidelity to breeding and nonbreeding sites. We did not observe strong migratory connectivity. Migratory oystercatchers distributed themselves widely along the coasts of British Columbia and southeast Alaska during winter. Results provide baseline information on the Black Oystercatcher's movements and space use throughout the annual cycle. © 2010 The Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Radar and satellite global positioning system-platform transmitter terminal (GPS-PTT) transmitters provide complementary information on the movements and behaviors of individual birds. The GPS-PTT tag provides a snapshot of altitude and location of a specific individual of an identified species at predefined intervals. The history of the individual is known because each transmitter has a unique identification code. The radar cannot identify individuals or even species but it provides continuous position reports (altitude and location) of birds within its detection range. By integrating data from the two sources, the behavior and movements of identified individuals (not possible with radar) can be continuously monitored (not possible with satellite tags). In this study the radar detected 40% of the locations of vultures carrying GPS-PTT tags that were within 5-km of the radar. Most (75%) of the locations that were not detected were calculated to be above or below the radar's antenna beam. Speed and direction values recorded by the GPS-PTT tags and the radar were poorly correlated because the vultures were soaring and circling, which produced rapid changes in both azimuth and ground speed of the targets. Nevertheless, our findings show that combining these two techniques can allow monitoring of species that are of conservation concern where it is otherwise difficult to follow identified individual birds. © 2010 The Authors.

abstract={We investigated whether domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) influenced the use of space by chilla foxes (Lycalopex griseus) in southern Chile and tested the hypothesis that dogs interfere with chillas. We used scent stations and occurrence of scats within systematically placed plots to assess habitat use by both species and to test whether dogs were associated to the use of space by chillas. Activity data were obtained from captures for both species, and telemetry for foxes. Diet of both species was analysed in order to tease out the potential existence of exploitation competition. We found that, when active, chillas used prairies more and native forest less than expected according to availability, whereas inactive chillas (during the day) preferred native forest, the only habitat type that dogs did not use. The odds of dog occurrence increased at shorter distance to human houses, whereas the inverse pattern was observed for chillas. Poisson models showed that the number of chilla visits to scent stations was negatively correlated with the number of dog visits. We observed dogs persecuting and/or killing chillas which was also corroborated by local people that used dogs to prevent chilla-related poultry losses, supporting the idea that dogs harass foxes actively. The analysis of scats showed that dogs fed mainly on house food and domestic ruminant carcasses whereas foxes fed on hare, hens, mice and wild birds, thus suggesting that exploitation competition is not a strong alternative hypothesis as a proximate cause for the patterns observed. We conclude that dogs seem to constrain the use of space by wild carnivores via interference. © 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2009 Ecological Society of Australia.},

abstract={In the 1990s, flocks of tens of thousands of Razorbills (Alca torda), greatly outnumbering the local breeding population and, so of unknown origin were observed wintering off the island of Grand Manan, Bay of Fundy, Canada. To determine their origin, 39 radio transmitters were deployed on Razorbills at major breeding centers at Corossol Island (n = 10), Québec, the Gannet Islands, Newfoundland and Labrador (n = 15), and a colony near the overwintering area at Machias Seal Island (n = 14) in 2007. From January-March 2008, flights around Grand Manan detected 19 transmitter-fitted birds - twelve from Machias Seal Island, five from Corossol Island and two from the Gannet Islands. The findings confirm that Razorbills making up the wintering flocks off Grand Manan are not only local birds but also birds from major centers of the North American breeding distribution. Therefore, North American Razorbills from all breeding areas are vulnerable to mismanagement of the Bay of Fundy ecosystem, already degraded by over-exploitation and threatened by pollution from a variety of energy developments.},

abstract={Efforts to protect endangered species sometimes involve removing animals from sites to be developed and translocating them to protected sites. This method has rarely been successful. Protected kangaroo rats in the San Joaquin Valley of California continue to lose habitat to development In 2001, 1 monitored four Tipton kangaroo rats( Dipodomys nitratoides nitratoides) and seven Heermann's kangaroo rats (D. heermanni ssp.) fitted with radio transmitters that were translocated away from development at an electrical substation to protected native land of the San Joaquin Valley, Kern County, California. I released translocated kangaroo rats into individual artificial burrows that were spaced 10-15 m apart and that were provisioned with bird seed. Only 1 individual survived the 45 days of the study. All four Tipton kangaroo rats were dead within 5 days of release, and all appear to have been eaten by predators. Two Heermann's kangaroo rats appeared to have been killed by conspecifics, three were killed by predators, and the fate of one was undetermined. If translocation is to be considered a useful conservation measure, kangaroo rats need to be released into habitat that is unoccupied, or nearly so, by conspecifics and the use of additional methods of protecting translocated individuals may be necessary.},

abstract={The endangered Rostrhamus sociabilis plumbeus (Florida Snail Kite) has been the focus of several ecological studies emphasizing movements between and within wetland fragments. These studies have required the ability to trap and radiotag free-flying adults without significant risk of injury. We developed and tested a safe alternative to previous methods for trapping Snail Kites as part of a comparative study of VHF and satellite telemetry. The aquatic bal-chatri borrows from historical trap designs with modifications for trapping aquatic birds at the surface of the water. It consists of a square PVC frame with a series of parallel flourocarbon stringers and a mesh basket to restrain the lure species. Nooses are attached to the stringers and used to ensnare the toes of a predatory bird. The trap is held afloat by the PVC frame, with the mesh basket, stringers, and nooses positioned just beneath the surface of the water. After determining effective trap placement in relation to perched birds, we captured 11 kites in 13 days with native pomacea paludosa (Florida Apple Snail) and exotic Pomacea insularum (Island Apple Snail) as lures. Our results indicated that the aquatic bal-chatri can be used to target specific Snail Kites and recapture previously trapped individuals. This trap design is a safe, efficient, and low-cost alternative to methods previously used for capturing Snail Kites. Additionally, the aquatic bal-chatri is relatively easy to use and appears to have minimal impact on foraging behavior and breeding performance of Snail Kites.},

Females left summer areas earlier and spent more time in staging areas than did males. However, both sexes left the staging areas and arrived in the wintering grounds at approximately the same time. There was no difference in latitude between wintering males and females, or in winter residency time (n = 136 days for both sexes). The predominant winter habitat types were lakes and coasts with only seven of 26 (26.9%) birds wintering on aquaculture sites. Contrary to expectations, winter home ranges of birds on aquaculture sites (x̄ = 2760 km2) were significantly larger than birds on non-aquaculture sites (x̄ = 81 km2). A carryover effect of aquaculture was not detected; winter residency time was similar for birds on both aquaculture and natural winter habitats, with birds from both habitats returning north at the same time.

A total of 43 female EP Tundra Swans were caught in Maryland, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia and marked with satellite transmitters to follow annual movements, delineate migration routes and determine Bird Conservation Region (BCR) use for EP Tundra Swans from November 2000-March 2002. Marked EP Tundra Swans spent approximately 3.5 months on breeding areas, 3.5 months on wintering areas and 5 months on staging areas, highlighting the importance of migratory habitats to these birds. Marked birds used 15 different ecologically distinct BCRs throughout the year: 10 during the spring, 11 during the autumn, four during the summer and six during the winter. The most important of these were the Prairie Potholes, Boreal Taiga Plains and Prairie Hardwood Transition during both spring and autumn; the Arctic Plains and Mountains during the summer; and the Mid-Atlantic coast during the winter. Fifty-five spring migration routes and 28 autumn routes used by marked birds were mapped. Seven sites were identified as being key migration staging areas that should be enhanced through habitat protection and management planning. © Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust.},

abstract={Context: Reproduction is a critical component of fitness, and understanding factors that influence temporal and spatial dynamics in reproductive output is important for effective management and conservation. Although several indices of reproductive output for wide-ranging species, such as migratory birds, exist, there has been no theoretical justification for their estimators or associated measures of variance. Aims The aims of our research were to develop statistical justification for an estimator of reproduction and associated variances on the basis of an existing national wing-collection survey and banding data, and to demonstrate the applicability of this estimator to a migratory game bird. Methods We used a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach to integrate wing-collection data, which provides information on population age ratios, and band-recovery data, which provides information on recovery probabilities of various age classes, for American woodcock (Scolopax minor) to estimate productivity and associated measures of variance. We present two models of relative vulnerability between age classes: one model assumed that adult recovery probabilities were higher, but that annual fluctuations were synchronous between the two age classes (i.e. an additive effect of age and year). The second model assumed that adults, on average, had higher recovery probabilities than did juveniles and that annual fluctuations were asynchronous through time (i.e. an interaction between age and year). Key results Fitting our models within a hierarchical Bayesian framework efficiently incorporates the two data types into a single estimator and derives appropriate variances for the productivity estimator. Further, use of Bayesian methods enabled us to derive credible intervals that avoid the reliance on asymptotic assumptions. When applied to American woodcock data, the additive model resulted in biologically realistic and more precise age-ratio estimates each year and is adequate when the relative vulnerability to sampling only slightly varies or does not vary among components of a population (e.g. age, sex class) among years. Therefore, we recommend using woodcock indices from our analysis based on this model. Conclusions We provide a flexible modelling framework for estimating productivity and associated variances that can incorporate ecological covariates to explore various factors that could drive annual dynamics in productivity. Applying our model to the American woodcock data indicated that assumptions about the variability in relative recovery probabilities could greatly influence the precision of our productivity estimator. Therefore, researchers should carefully consider the assumption of temporally variable relative recovery probabilities (i.e. ratio of juvenile to adults' recovery probability) for different age classes when applying this estimator. Implications Several national and international management strategies for migratory game birds in North America rely on measures of productivity from harvest survey parts collections, without a justification of the estimator or providing estimates of precision. We derive an estimator of productivity with realistic measures of uncertainty that can be directly incorporated into management plans or ecological studies across large spatial scales. © 2010 CSIRO.},

abstract={Loss and degradation of native grasslands on the North American landscape are some of the key factors influencing population declines of grassland songbirds. It is unclear what role anthropogenic grasslands play in the conservation of grassland specialists and whether demographic parameters of grassland songbirds differ between anthropogenic and native grasslands. Furthermore, there has been little research examining the overlap (or lack thereof) between nesting and post-fledging habitat. We initiated a radio-telemetry study from 2004 to 2008 on dispersal, microhabitat use, and survival of juvenile Sprague's pipits (Anthus spragueii), a threatened grassland-obligate songbird, in native pastures and fields planted with exotic species (planted grasslands). Dispersal distance was greater in planted compared to native grasslands, but appeared to be constrained to natal fields up to 26-d post-fledging. Pipits used microhabitats in planted grasslands with vegetation that was on average 11. cm taller than used locations in native pastures, possibly due to the rapid growth of planted vegetation by the time individuals fledged. Individuals that were reared in planted grasslands had consistently lower daily survival rates compared to those in native pastures. Our observation that young birds rarely left their natal field suggests that conserving nesting habitat in native pastures would be an effective management strategy for this species. However, our results suggest that planted grasslands may act as population sinks given the lower survival of juvenile pipits reared in planted fields in our region. Demographic studies during the post-fledging period are essential to determine the conservation value of anthropogenic grasslands for North American songbirds. © 2010.},

abstract={Widespread decline of Neotropical migrant songbirds requires better understanding of the mechanisms driving juvenile mortality. We used mark-resight encounter histories of 3,990 banded fledglings (1998-2002) to test whether late breeding or large brood size negatively affected apparent annual and migration.wintering survival probability of juvenile Purple Martins (Progne subis). We estimated apparent annual juvenile survival (φa, fledging to 1 year old) by resighting individuals as adults at regional breeding colonies and at a premigratory roost. We tested for carryover effects of fledge week and brood size on migration-wintering survival (φm, premigratory roost to 1 year old) using two encounter occasions per season (premigratory roost, breeding colony) to partition annual survival into premigration versus migration-wintering survival. Annual survival (± SE) was 0.27 ± 0.027 and the best model (model weight = 0.93) included week of fledging and brood size, with survival probability decreasing with increasing fledge date and brood size. Apparent fledgling survival probability to premigratory roosts (φr) was 0.87 ± 0.03 and migration-wintering juvenile survival (φm) averaged 0.32 ± 0.04 (range: 0.25-0.46 among years). The best model included an effect of fledging week (model weight = 0.99) on migration-wintering survival but little support for brood size effects. Late-fledged young that survive to begin migration may incur higher subsequent mortality because of less foraging time and experience before migration. Telemetry of 15 fledglings in 2007 also revealed high premigration survival to the premigratory roost (0.73). Most (81%) juvenile mortality occurred after the onset of migration. Juvenile recruitment and population dynamics are likely closely linked to migration and wintering ground threats. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2011.},

abstract={Greater Roadrunners (Geococcyx californianus) are common, poorly studied birds of arid and semi-arid ecosystems in the southwestern United States. Conservation of this avian predator requires a detailed understanding of their movements and spatial requirements that is currently lacking. From 2006 to 2009, we quantified home-range and core area sizes and overlap, habitat selection, and survival of roadrunners (N= 14 males and 20 females) in north-central Texas using radio-telemetry and fixed kernel estimators. Median home-range and core-area sizes were 90.4 ha and 19.2 ha for males and 80.1 ha and 16.7 ha for females, respectively. The size of home range and core areas did not differ significantly by either sex or season. Our home range estimates were twice as large (x̄= 108.9 ha) as earlier published estimates based on visual observations (x̄= 28-50 ha). Mean percent overlap was 38.4% for home ranges and 13.7% for core areas. Male roadrunners preferred mesquite woodland and mesquite savanna cover types, and avoided the grass-forb cover type. Female roadrunners preferred mesquite savanna and riparian woodland cover types, and avoided grass-forb habitat. Kaplan-Meier annual survival probabilities for females (0.452 ± 0.118[SE]) were twice that estimated for males (0.210 ± 0.108), but this difference was not significant. Mortality rates of male roadrunners were higher than those of females during the spring when males call from elevated perches, court females, and chase competing males. Current land use practices that target woody-shrub removal to enhance livestock forage production could be detrimental to roadrunner populations by reducing availability of mesquite woodland and mesquite savanna habitat required for nesting and roosting and increasing the amount of grass-forb habitat that roadrunners avoid. ©2011 The Authors.

abstract={The northern common eider (Somateria mollissima borealis) has become a source of concern because of recent declines and possible overharvest. Birds that breed in the Canadian mid-Arctic winter in both Greenland and Canada, but the wintering grounds of birds that breed farther south are unknown. Our objectives were thus to identify the molting and wintering areas of birds breeding in Ungava Bay and to compare their home-range sizes during the pre-molt, molt, post-molt, and winter periods. Using satellite telemetry, we determined that common eiders breeding in the lower Arctic winter in Greenland (67%) and Canada (33%). These proportions are consistent with the split established for common eiders that breed farther north. Females spent their pre-molt period close to their breeding islands and had the smallest home ranges during the molt period. Winter home ranges were larger in Canada than in Greenland, probably because they contained more ice. Once settled, birds wintered in a relatively small area and did not undertake long movements. Distance between molt and winter sites ranged between 1054 and 2173 km. Duration of migration to or from wintering areas varied among individuals from rapid movement in a few days to slow progress over a month. Fall migration occurred in late October or early November, and spring migration, in early to mid-May. This study highlights the importance of Ungava Bay for northern common eiders and the need for international collaboration to ensure sustainable use of the resource. © The Arctic Institute of North America.},

abstract={Habitat conditions and nutrient reserve levels during spring migration have been suggested as important factors affecting population declines in waterfowl, emphasizing the need to identify key sites used during spring and understand habitat features and resource availability at stopover sites. We used satellite telemetry to identify stopover sites used by surf scoters migrating through southeast Alaska during spring. We then contrasted habitat features of these sites to those of random sites to determine habitat attributes corresponding to use by migrating scoters. We identified 14 stopover sites based on use by satellite tagged surf scoters from several wintering sites. We identified Lynn Canal as a particularly important stopover site for surf scoters originating throughout the Pacific winter range; approximately half of tagged coastally migrating surf scoters used this site, many for extended periods. Stopover sites were farther from the mainland coast and closer to herring spawn sites than random sites, whereas physical shoreline habitat attributes were generally poor predictors of site use. The geography and resource availability within southeast Alaska provides unique and potentially critical stopover habitat for spring migrating surf scoters. Our work identifies specific sites and habitat resources that deserve conservation and management consideration. Aggregations of birds are vulnerable to human activity impacts such as contaminant spills and resource management decisions. This information is of value to agencies and organizations responsible for emergency response planning, herring fisheries management, and bird and ecosystem conservation.

abstract={Cross-seasonal studies of avian movement establish links between geographically distinct wintering, breeding, and migratory stopover locations, or assess site fidelity and movement between distinct phases of the annual cycle. Far fewer studies have investigated individual movement patterns within and among seasons over an annual cycle. Within western Oregon's Willamette Valley throughout 2007, we quantified intra- and interseasonal movement patterns, fidelity (regional and local), and migratory patterns of 37 radiomarked Wilson's Snipe (Gallinago delicata) to elucidate residency in a region of breeding- and wintering-range overlap. Telemetry revealed complex regional population structure, including winter residents (74%), winter transients (14%), summer residents (9%), and one year-round resident breeder (3%). Results indicated a lack of connectivity between winter and summer capture populations, some evidence of partial migration, and between-season fidelity to the region (winter-resident return; subsequent fall). Across seasons, the extent of movements and use of multiple wetland sites suggested that Wilson's Snipe were capable of exploratory movements but more regularly perceived local and fine-scale segments of the landscape as connected. Movements differed significantly by season and residency; individuals exhibited contracted movements during late winter and more expansive movements during precipitation-limited periods (late spring, summer, fall). Mean home-range size was 3.5 ± 0.93 km2 (100% minimum convex polygon [MCP]) and 1.6 ± 0.42 km2 (95% fixed kernel) and did not vary by sex; however, home range varied markedly by season (range of 100% MCPs: 1.04-7.56 km2). The results highlight the need to consider seasonal and interspecific differences in shorebird life histories and space-use requirements when developing regional wetland conservation plans. © 2011 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

abstract={From 1995 to 1998, we tracked movements of adult Swainson's Hawks (Buteo swainsoni), using satellite telemetry to characterize migration, important stopover areas, and movements in the austral summer. We tagged 46 hawks from July to September on their nesting grounds in seven U.S. states and two Canadian provinces. Swainson's Hawks followed three basic routes south on a broad front, converged along the east coast of central Mexico, and followed a concentrated corridor to a communal area in central Argentina for the austral summer. North of 20° N, southward and northward tracks differed little for individuals from east of the continental divide but differed greatly (up to 1700 km) for individuals from west of the continental divide. Hawks left the breeding grounds mid-August to mid-October; departure dates did not differ by location, year, or sex. Southbound migration lasted 42 to 98 days, northbound migration 51 to 82 days. Southbound, 36% of the Swainson's Hawks departed the nesting grounds nearly 3 weeks earlier than the other radio-marked hawks and made stopovers 9.0-26.0 days long in seven separate areas, mainly in the southern Great Plains, southern Arizona and New Mexico, and northcentral Mexico. The birds stayed in their nonbreeding range for 76 to 128 days. All used a core area in central Argentina within 23% of the 738 800-km2 austral summer range, where they frequently moved long distances (up to 1600 km). Conservation of Swainson's Hawks must be an international effort that considers habitats used during nesting and non-nesting seasons, including migration stopovers.

abstract={To assess and improve existing monitoring protocols for sharp-tailed grouse (Tympanuchus phasianellus) in the eastern Upper Peninsula of Michigan, we used data from 58 radio-collared grouse (46 M, 12 F) monitored within 3 openland landscape types: a xeric, conifer-dominated site, a wetland-dominated site, and a site dominated by low-intensity agriculture. We used lek counts and radio telemetry to determine lek attendance rates, factors affecting lek attendance rates, lek fidelity, and inter-sexual variation in these parameters. Our analysis indicated lek attendance varied with respect to sex of bird, day of year, time after sunrise, and wind speed. Peak male lek attendance rates exceeded those of females by up to 40%, and peak lekking activity for both males and females occurred during the second and third weeks of April. Male lekking activity occurred earlier and was sustained longer than that of females. Lekking activity was negatively related to time of day and wind speed. We observed strong lek fidelity as radio-collared birds attended a primary lek 94% of the time, indicating a low probability of multiple counting of individual birds. We also proposed a method to adjust lek count data for the probability that birds are on a lek during lek counts. Our proposed method can be used by researchers and managers to improve estimates of the number of birds attending a lek by reducing the negative bias associated with observed counts. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Models are important tools that can help managers and researchers understand the population dynamics of a species and how different habitat or population management scenarios impact that species.We used radio-telemetry data from northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) in southern Texas from 2000 to 2005 to develop a stochastic simulationmodel for bobwhite populations.Ourmodel is based on difference equations, with stochastic variables drawn from normal and Weibull distributions.We simulated bobwhite populations to 100 yr and evaluated our model by comparing results with independent estimates of 4 population parameters (spring and fall density, finite rate of increase in the fall population [l], and winter juv:ad age ratios). Using a quasi-extinction criterion of ≤40 birds (density = ≤0.05 birds/ha), probability of persistence to 100 yr was 88.3% (106 of 120 simulations) for the spring population and 96.7% (116 of 120 simulations) for the fall population. Using a less restrictive quasi-extinction criteria (≤14 birds), probability of persistence was 93.3% (112 of 120 simulations) for the spring population and 98.3% (118 of 120 simulations) for the fall population. Simulated population parameters were similar to independent estimates for 4 of 4 population parameters. Winter age ratios differed between our model (x- = 4:98 juv:ad, n = 120, SE = 0.32) and empirical age ratios fromharvested bobwhites on our study area (x- = 2:85 juv:ad, n = 25, SE = 0.24). However, when we corrected harvest age ratios for bias in juvenile harvest (x- = 3:85 juv:ad, n = 25, SE = 0.32) simulated and empirical estimates were similar.Our model appears to be a reliable predictor of bobwhite populations in the southern Texas. Our simulation results indicate that bobwhite hunters andmanagers can expect excellent bobwhite hunting (fall populations ≥2.2 birds per ha) in about one of 10 yr. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Rock pigeons (Columba livia) have been implicated in the spread of pathogens within commercial livestock facilities. Currently, there is no data characterizing pigeon habitat use and movement patterns within and among commercial livestock facilities. To better understand the capacity for pigeons to spread pathogens, we used radio-telemetry techniques to estimate the home-range, travel distance, activity, and habitat use of pigeons roosting on and off dairies and feedlots in western Weld County, Colorado. Our observations suggest that pigeons roosting on (resident) and off (nonresident) livestock facilities use habitat differently. Nonresident pigeons used larger home-range areas than did resident pigeons. Nonresident pigeons traveled farther and frequented more livestock facilities than did resident pigeons. Both resident and nonresident pigeons disproportionally selected livestock facilities over other available foraging sites. We detected no difference in pigeon activities (i.e. loafi ng, feeding, drinking, fl ying) between resident and nonresident pigeons. Data suggest that nonresident pigeons may vector livestock pathogens among livestock facilities and resident pigeons may aid in the amplifi cation and maintenance of pathogens within livestock facilities. Thus, targeted management of pigeons may help mitigate the introduction and maintenance of pathogens that cause disease and economic loss within livestock facilities.},

abstract={The recent application of stable-isotope analyses, particularly the use of stablehydrogen-isotope (δD) measurements of animal tissues, has greatly improved our ability to infer geographic origins of migratory animals. However, many individual sources of error contribute to the overall error in assignment; thus likelihood-based assignments incorporating estimates of error are now favored. In addition, globally, the nature of the underlying precipitation-based δD isoscapes is such that longitudinal resolution is often compromised. For example, in North America, amount-weighted expected mean growing-season precipitation δD is similar between the boreal forest of southwestern Canada and areas of northern Quebec/Labrador and Alaska. Thus, it can often be difficult to distinguish objectively between these areas as potential origins for broadly distributed migrants using a single isotopic measurement. We developed a Bayesian framework for assigning geographic origins to migrant birds based on combined stable-isotope analysis of feathers and models of migratory directions estimated from band recovery data. We outline our method and show an example of its application for assigning origins to a population of migrant White-throated Sparrows (Zonotrichia albicollis) sampled at a Canadian Migration Monitoring Network station at Delta Marsh, Manitoba, Canada. We show that likelihood-based assignments of geographic origins can provide improved spatial resolution when models of migration direction are combined with assignments based on δD analysis of feathers. © 2011 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Estimates of goose harvest by the National Harvest Survey (NHS) in Canada are based on the assumption that species composition of harvest by non-Canadians that hunt in Canada is equivalent to that of Canadians. Non-Canadian hunters are not sampled for composition of species harvested, so differences in proportions harvested per hunter could lead to biased harvest estimates; bias would increase with increasing proportions of unsampled non-Canadians in relation to sampled Canadian hunters. My objective was to test the assumption of equality of species composition between these 2 strata of hunters for Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba using recoveries of cackling (Branta hutchinsii), Ross's (Chen rossii), lesser snow (C. caerulescens caerulescens), and greater white-fronted (Anser albifrons) geese marked south of Queen Maud Gulf in Nunavut, Canada'sCentral Arctic. I usedmultinomial logistic regression of recoveries between Canadian and non-Canadian hunters controlling for hunting season. Non-Canadian hunters selected Ross's geese over white-fronted geese compared to Canadians hunting in both Alberta and Saskatchewan, where all 4 species are harvested. Thus, harvest estimates for Ross's geese may be biased low in Alberta and Saskatchewan and those for white-fronted geese biased high. Waterfowl species harvested by non- Canadians could be sampled to estimate and correct biases in the NHS. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Golf courses ostensibly offer green space in urbanized areas, but it is unclear how suitable these human-modified habitats are for wildlife populations. Golf courses are home to a variety of wildlife, but in particular they have been the focus of research on avian responses to urbanization. Although numerous reproductive and diversity studies have been conducted on birds of golf courses, no research exists on postfledging survival in this created landscape. In 2008 and 2009, we estimated survival of eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) fledglings using radio telemetry on golf course and other developed sites in Williamsburg, Virginia. We used nest survival models in Program MARK set in an information theoretic framework to assess whether the golf course habitat predicted mortality along with other previously studied variables, such as fledgling age, year, site, body condition, fledging date, and transmitter weight. We found no evidence that inhabiting a golf course increased mortality during the fledgling period, but we did find support for both fledgling age and fledging date as predictors of survival. Mortality decreased for older fledglings and those that fledged later in the season. Cause-specific postfledging survival rates did not differ among sites. Fledgling bluebirds did, however, move into habitat that was significantly more forested and less grassy than their natal habitat. For managers of wildlife on golf courses and other urbanized sites, our study is the first to show that placing nest boxes in manicured habitat may attract birds to areas without suitable habitat for fledglings. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Population models for many animals are limited by a lack of information regarding juvenile survival. In particular, studies of songbird reproductive output typically terminate with the success or failure of nests, despite the fact that adults spend the rest of the reproductive season rearing dependent fledglings. Unless fledgling survival does not vary, or varies consistently with nest productivity, conclusions about population dynamics based solely on nest data may be misleading. During 2007 and 2008, we monitored nests and used radio telemetry to monitor fledgling survival for a population of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) in a managed-forest landscape in north-central Minnesota, USA. In addition to estimating nest and fledgling survival, we modeled growth for population segments partitioned by proximity to edges of non-nesting cover types (regenerating clearcuts). Nest survival was significantly lower, but fledgling survival was significantly higher, in 2007 than in 2008. Despite higher nest productivity in 2008, seasonal productivity (number of young surviving to independence per breeding female) was higher in 2007. Proximity to clearcut edge did not affect nest productivity. However, fledglings from nests near regenerating sapling-dominated clearcuts (7-20 years since harvest) had higher daily survival (0.992 ± 0.005) than those from nests in interior forest (0.978 ± 0.006), which in turn had higher daily survival than fledglings from nests near shrub-dominated clearcuts (≤6 years since harvest; 0.927 ± 0.030) in 2007, with a similar but statistically non-significant trend in 2008. Our population growth models predicted growth rates that differed by 2-39% (x=25%) from simpler models in which we replaced our estimates of first-year survival with one-half adult annual survival (an estimate commonly used in songbird population growth models). We conclude that nest productivity is an inadequate measure of songbird seasonal productivity, and that results based exclusively on nest data can yield misleading conclusions about population growth and clearcut edge effects. We suggest that direct estimates of juvenile survival could provide more accurate information for the management and conservation of many animal taxa. © 2011 Streby and Andersen.},

abstract={Ornithological research from the Bartlett Experimental Forest in New Hampshire, U.S.A. has provided information useful for developing management practices for northern hardwoods forests and understanding factors affecting avian populations. This work also serves to illustrate numerous features and characteristics of experimental forests that facilitate research. One example is opportunities for long-term and interdisciplinary research, illustrated by the application of a 25-year data set on snag longevity collected as part of a silvicultural experiment to evaluate habitat conditions for cavity nesting birds. Experimental forests also provide a conduit for information to managers by virtue of their collocation with U.S National Forests (Stoleson and King, this issue). At the time bird research was initiated on the Bartlett Experimental Forest the potential for forest management to fragment habitat in forested landscapes in the northeast U.S.A. was unknown, because the only studies on this topic were from the Midwest or Mid-Atlantic States where forest patches are isolated by agricultural or suburban development. Research on the Bartlett Experimental Forest has provided managers with region-specific information on the potential for silviculture and associated development to fragment forests, indicating that unlike less forested landscapes, cowbirds (Molothrus ater) are rare, and that edges created by forest roads in extensively forested landscapes have little effect on mature forest birds. Research from the Bartlett Experimental Forest has also provided guidance to managers for providing habitat for shrubland birds, both in terms of silvicultural prescriptions (Yamasaki et al., in preparation) and patch area (Costello et al., 2000). Experimental Forests also provide access to facilities and infrastructure, such as road networks, laboratory space and housing, to facilitate research requiring frequent access to sites, such as radio telemetry investigations (King et al., 2006; Chandler, 2006). © 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Knowledge of stopovers made by migratory birds comes mostly from studies at relatively fine spatial scales. While this focus yields important information about processes at those scales, it ignores possible processes acting at broader spatial scales. We established an array of three automated radio-telemetry receiver towers housing ten antennas arranged to sample a landscape and its associated airspace at Lake Erie in southern Canada. We used digitally coded tags to monitor the behavior of multiple Swainson's and Hermit Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus and C. guttatus) simultaneously during fall 2008. The towers registered flight activity of 86% of the 69 radio-tagged individuals, whose flights occurred predominantly shortly after the end of evening civil twilight. We recorded 15 nocturnal flights that were not departure flights, indicating that during stopover passerines make nocturnal flights for purposes other than the continuation of migration. The flights we recorded were distributed throughout the night, and in eight cases they resulted in individuals moving many kilometers. These multiple instances of nocturnal landscape-scale movements represent an ecological process that is not detectable when the focus of sampling is too small. We suggest that in most studies of passerines' stopover ecology, researchers need to consider temporal and spatial scales more carefully. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2011.},

abstract={Recent evidence indicates that insectivorous birds in shade coffee farms provide economically significant ecosystem services by reducing insect pests, which should encourage cultivation practices favouring birds and other wildlife. However, the provisioning of this service may be dependent on landscape composition and movement patterns of these mobile consumers. Very little information is currently available on bird movements in coffee-dominated landscapes. We examined roosting behaviour in Black-throated Blue Warblers Dendroica caerulescens on two Jamaican coffee farms using radio telemetry in order to determine whether birds commute between nocturnal roosts and diurnal foraging ranges in coffee habitat. Nocturnal tracking revealed most birds moved outside diurnal foraging ranges on the farms to roost in forested habitat patches, sometimes up to 1 km away. Of 42 roost locations, only eight roosts were within the coffee farm perimeter: one individual in a coffee bush, and seven others in shade trees or vegetated riparian strips. Logistic regression confirmed that birds strongly selected continuous forest and individual trees over coffee for roosting. These findings reflect the ecological connectivity between coffee habitats and the adjacent landscape and raise the possibility that the provisioning of pest reduction services could be at least partly dependent on a farm"s proximity to forest patches.

Of 816 wetlands surveyed between 2004 and 2006 in the BTZ, 4045% (105127 lakes annually) had molting goldeneyes. Of these, 1.33.3% were used by large aggregations of goldeneyes (>100 birds). Two wetlands, Cardinal and Leddy Lakes, were particularly important, with an estimated 5,0007,000 Barrow's Goldeneyes, primarily adult males, using these sites during remigial molt and fall staging. Birds used these sites up to five months or over one-third of their annual cycle. Half of adult males marked with satellite transmitters at a breeding area in interior British Columbia used Cardinal Lake for postbreeding activities. Discovery of these sites represents some of the largest concentrations of molting Barrow's Goldeneyes in North America, and the only major molting sites currently known for the intermountain breeding portion of the western population. Protection of Cardinal and Leddy Lakes, and other significant molting and staging sites within the BTZ, should be a priority conservation effort for this species.},

Turkey vultures had larger seasonal home ranges than did black vultures, and 2 turkey vultures made round-trips to Florida. Black vultures consistently spent less time in flight (8.4%) than did turkey vultures (18.9%), and black vultures flew at higher altitudes than did turkey vultures in all seasons except summer when altitudinal distributions (above ground level) did not differ. Although we recorded maximum altitudes of 1,578 m for black vultures and 1,378 for turkey vultures, most flights were low altitude. A matrix of vulture flight altitude versus time of day revealed that >60% of vulture flight activity occurred from 4 hr to 9 hr after sunrise at altitudes below 200 m.

Males spent, on average, 23.5% of their time off their fragment, while females were gone 12.8% of the time tracked. Most forays were >150 m in distance and foray rate to adjacent fragments declined with increasing gap width. Males on fragments spent more time off their territory (23.5%) and traveled farther (392 m) than males occupying territories within a continuous forest (4.8% and 99 m, respectively). In fragments, 10 out of 17 individuals spent >80% of their time within 20 m of the fragment edge and edge use was significantly more than expected based on the amount of edge available in each fragment.

abstract={Although metal legbands have been an important scientific tool, their use for estimation of harvest and survival relies on samples of dead birds harvested by hunters using shotguns. We hypothesized that the force of steel pellets discharged from a shotgun, within the range of conditions normally experienced by goose hunters, was sufficient to reduce probability of band retention. We conducted 8 experimental trials to estimate retention per round fired at aluminum bands normally applied to arctic-nesting geese in relation to effects of 1) target range (20 m vs. 40 m), 2) steel pellet size (4.57 mm [BB] vs. 3.81 mm [number 2]), 3) cartridge size (76.2 mm [3 in.] vs. 69.9 mm [2.75 in.]), and 4) number of rounds fired (up to 25). There was nearly complete band retention (0.999/round) at 40 m regardless of shot size or shell size used. Retention per round fired at 20 m declined to between 0.984 and 0.987 for number 2 shot and between 0.968 and 0.974 for BB shot. Our conclusions apply to unworn bands, so we recommend further simulations to assess how retention may change with age of bands as they erode or corrode on free-ranging geese. Bias in estimates associated with loss of older bands from shotgun discharge could be adjusted if bias is estimated as done in this article. © The Wildlife Society, 2011.},

abstract={Post-breeding ecology of shrubland passerines prior to onset of migration is unknown relative to dynamics of breeding areas. We radiomarked and monitored 38 Sage Sparrows (Amphispiza belli ssp. nevadensis) at one site in Oregon and two in Nevada from September to mid-November 2007 to track local movements, estimate seasonal range sizes, and characterize weather patterns triggering onset of migration. Median area used by Sage Sparrows monitored between 3 and 18 days during or prior to migration was 14 ha; maximum daily movement was 15 km. Radio-marked Sage Sparrows at each location departed individually, rather than en masse, corresponding with passage of cold front weather systems. Conventional telemetry techniques limited our ability to monitor Sage Sparrows beyond pre-migratory periods and precluded detecting and tracking actual movements during migration. © 2011 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={We used satellite telemetry to document spring migration phenology, routes, stopover regions, and nesting sites of mallards Anas platyrhynchos marked in Arkansas during the winters of 2004-2007. Of the 143 marked mallards that migrated from Arkansas, they did so, on average, by mid-March. Mallards flew over the Missouri Ozarks and 42% made an initial stopover in Missouri, where they used areas that had larger rivers (Mississippi River, Missouri River) embedded in an agricultural landscape. From this stopover region they either migrated directly to the Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) or they migrated north to Minnesota where they either moved next to the PPR or to the north and east of the PPR. For those mallards (83%) that stopped for >1 d before entering the PPR, the average length at each stop was 12 d (SE = 0.90 d, range = 2-54 d). Mallards made more stopovers, made shorter migration movements, and took longer to move to the PPR in wetter than drier years. Mallards arrived in the PPR earlier in 2006 (x = 30 March, SE = 2.18 d) than in 2005 (x = 7 April, SE = 2.30 d). Females nested across nine Bird Conservation Regions. Nesting occurred most frequently in South Dakota (n = 9). The average date when females nested was 19 April (SE = 2.44 d, range = 12 March-26 May). Because many mallards headed for the large river corridors in Missouri for their first stopover, this region is an important spring migration stopover of continental importance to mallards and might be considered a focal area for conservation.},

Our hypothesis that the area determined by radio-tracking would be significantly larger than the area defined by observations of males singing and perching was rejected, but the area determined by radio-tracking was almost twice the area defined by observations of breeding males singing and perching.},

abstract={Studies of the effects of transmitters on passerines have provided mixed results, but many have revealed no negative impacts. Most such studies have been conducted during the breeding season and, as a result, little is known about the possible effects of transmitters on wintering birds. We examined the effects of transmitters on Bicknell's Thrushes (Catharus bicknelli) wintering in the Dominican Republic. We used long-term mark-recapture data to compare birds with radio-transmitters (N= 5 years, 64 individuals) to birds banded, but not radio-tagged (N= 10 years, 164 individuals). For a subset of birds in each category, we measured the change in mass between early-winter and late-winter and, for all birds, we calculated return rates and modeled annual survival by sex and age classes. Return rates of radio-tagged (16%) and banded-only individuals (17%) did not differ, and survival models including the effect of transmitter attachment were poorly supported. We also found no sex or age-specific effects of transmitter attachment. Radio-tagged and banded-only birds did not differ either in the proportion of birds gaining mass during the winter or amount of mass gained. Our results indicate that attaching light-weight transmitters (<5% of body mass) to wintering Bicknell's Thrushes did not adversely affect either body condition or annual survival. © 2012 The Authors.

Hummingbirds represent a particular challenge for traditional avian color-marking techniques because of their small size and short tarsi. Although several techniques have been successfully used, the retention time of color-markers and their safety and ease of construction could be improved. I developed two new color-marking techniques for marking Little Hermits (Phaethornis longuemareus): (1) a plastic back tag constructed by fusing colored beads, and (2) a leg tag attached to a metal band fitted around the tarsus. Both tag designs were visible in field conditions, and neither appeared to adversely affect behavior. Both back and leg tags had high retention rates within seasons, but back tags had a poor retention rate between years. Although these marking techniques were designed for use on one species of hummingbird, they would likely also be useful with other species of hummingbirds. © 2012 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={In northern marine habitats, the presence or absence of sea ice results in variability in the distribution of many species and the quality and availability of pelagic winter habitat. To understand the effects of ice on intra- and inter-annual winter site fidelity and movements in a northern sea-duck species, we marked 25 adult Pacific Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima v-nigrum) on their nesting area at Cape Espenberg, Alaska, with satellite transmitters and monitored their movements to their wintering areas in the northern Bering Sea for a 2-year period. We examined changes in winter fidelity in relation to home-range characteristics and ice. Characteristics of polynyas (areas with persistent open water during winter) varied substantially and likely had an effect on the size of winter ranges and movements within polynyas. Movements within polynyas were correlated with changes in weather that affected ice conditions. Ninety-five percent of individuals were found within their 95% utilization distribution (UD) of the previous year, and 90% were found within their 50% UD. Spatial distributions of winter locations between years changed for 32% of the individuals; however, we do not consider these subtle movements biologically significant. Although ice conditions varied between polynyas within and between years, the Common Eiders monitored in our study showed a high degree of fidelity to their winter areas. This observation is counterintuitive, given the requirement that resources are predictable for site fidelity to occur; however, ice may not have been severe enough to restrict access to other resources and, subsequently, force birds to move. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2012.

abstract={Satellite telemetry can provide valuable information on spatial ecology of animals, especially in species inhabiting remote areas such as the Arctic. However, caution is always needed when selecting transmitter size and attachment methods because of the potential negative impact of the device itself on individuals. We determined survival and reproductive performance of adult female snowy owls (Bubo scandiacus) tracked by satellite to evaluate potential adverse effects of transmitters. In summer 2007, we captured 12 adult females on their nest in the Canadian Arctic, marked them with 30-g harness-mounted transmitters, and tracked their movement for up to 3 years. All marked birds resumed normal activities shortly (<60 min) after release and none deserted their nest. We had 2 known deaths and 2 transmitters that stopped moving over 3 years, yielding an annual survival rate between 85.2 Â± 7.0% and 92.3 Â± 5.7%. Moreover, summer movement patterns, combined with ground checks in several cases, suggested that all successfully tracked birds initiated a nest every year after marking. Finally, laying date and clutch size of individuals did not differ before and after marking. Overall, our data indicate that life history traits of adult female snowy owls were not affected by satellite transmitters. © 2012 The Wildlife Society. Copyright © The Wildlife Society, 2012.},

To a large extent, this is based on measurements in the laboratory of animals placed on restricted diets and kept at low Ta. Information on the determinants of torpor employment in the field is limited. We assessed winter torpor by insectivorous, free-ranging Australian owlet-nightjars (Aegotheles cristatus; 22 birds, 834 bird-days over six winters). Birds in three habitats were investigated to test whether torpor use is affected by annual Ta, rainfall, and arthropod abundance. Owlet-nightjars entered daily torpor regularly at all sites. Torpor frequency, depth and bout duration were greatest during two periods with lower arthropod abundance, providing rare evidence of the link between food availability and torpor patterns of wild birds. Temporal organization of torpor was similar among sites, and nocturnal torpor was more frequent than previously reported. Our findings quantitatively demonstrate that reduced food resources affect torpor usage independently from Ta, and support the view that food availability is a primary ecological determinant of torpor use in the wild. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Since the 1960s, anthropogenic shifts in the timing and distribution of surface-water flows in the Everglades have pushed back the onset of reproduction in Wood Storks (Mycteria americana). Late nesting increases the probability that juveniles leave the colony during the summer rainy season, when water levels are high and prey animals unavailable. We used satellite telemetry to track firstyear survival of 85 Wood Storks from southern Florida over 4 years. We further evaluated survival in relation to hydrologic and physiologic variables, including water depths, surface-water recession rates, May rainfall, use of wetland habitats, sex, total feather mercury, whiteblood-cell counts, and heterophil:lymphocyte ratios for a subset of 71 birds, using a known-fates model in Program MARK. Juveniles that dispersed from the colony during favorable conditions (surface water depths <25 cm) had a first-year survival rate of 0.37 ± 0.06 (SE), compared with 0.15 ± 0.04 for those that dispersed into unfavorable conditions (depths >25 cm). General hydrologic conditions (favorable vs. unfavorable), wetland habitat use, and white-blood-cell counts were the best predictors of monthly survival, and the strongest effects were associated with the first month postdispersal. Our study is the first to show a relationship between temporally fluctuating hydrologic variables and survival of juvenile Wood Storks, highlighting the need to consider the timing of hydrologic manipulations when managing wetlands for birds. We conclude that human-induced changes in the temporal patterns of hydrology may have important consequences for the phenology and, ultimately, the demography of wetland birds.

abstract={Red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) populations have declined in the United States and Canada over the past 40a years. However, few demographic studies have been published on the species and none have addressed adult survival. During 2006-2007, we estimated survival probabilities of 80 radio-tagged red-headed woodpeckers during the breeding season in mature loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) forests in South Carolina. We used known-fate models in Program MARK to estimate survival within and between years and to evaluate the effects of foliar cover (number of available cover patches), snag density treatment (high density vs. low density), and sex and age of woodpeckers. Weekly survival probabilities followed a quadratic time trend, being lowest during mid-summer, which coincided with the late nestling and fledgling period. Avian predation, particularly by Cooper's (Accipiter cooperii) and sharp-shinned hawks (A. striatus), accounted for 85% of all mortalities. Our best-supported model estimated an 18-week breeding season survival probability of 0.72 (95% CIa =a 0.54-0.85) and indicated that the number of cover patches interacted with sex of woodpeckers to affect survival; females with few available cover patches had a lower probability of survival than either males or females with more cover patches. At the median number of cover patches available (na =a 6), breeding season survival of females was 0.82 (95% CIa =a 0.54-0.94) and of males was 0.60 (95% CIa =a 0.42-0.76). The number of cover patches available to woodpeckers appeared in all 3 of our top models predicting weekly survival, providing further evidence that woodpecker survival was positively associated with availability of cover. Woodpecker survival was not associated with snag density. Our results suggest that protection of ≥0.7 cover patches per ha during vegetation control activities in mature pine forests will benefit survival of this Partners In Flight Watch List species. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Inbreeding depression is frequently a concern of managers interested in restoring endangered species. Decisions to reduce the potential for inbreeding depression by balancing genotypic contributions to reintroduced populations may exact a cost on long-term demographic performance of the population if those decisions result in reduced numbers of animals released and/or restriction of particularly successful genotypes (i. e., heritable traits of particular family lines). As part of an effort to restore a migratory flock of Whooping Cranes (Grus americana) to eastern North America using the offspring of captive breeders, we obtained a unique dataset which includes post-release mark-recapture data, as well as the pedigree of each released individual. We developed a Bayesian formulation of a multi-state model to analyze radio-telemetry, band-resight, and dead recovery data on reintroduced individuals, in order to track survival and breeding state transitions. We used studbook-based individual covariates to examine the comparative evidence for and degree of effects of inbreeding, genotype, and genotype quality on post-release survival of reintroduced individuals. We demonstrate implementation of the Bayesian multi-state model, which allows for the integration of imperfect detection, multiple data types, random effects, and individual- and time-dependent covariates. Our results provide only weak evidence for an effect of the quality of an individual's genotype in captivity on post-release survival as well as for an effect of inbreeding on post-release survival. We plan to integrate our results into a decision-analytic modeling framework that can explicitly examine tradeoffs between the effects of inbreeding and the effects of genotype and demographic stochasticity on population establishment. © 2011 Springer-Verlag (outside the USA).},

abstract={Studies of songbird breeding habitat often compare habitat characteristics of used and unused areas. Although there is usually meticulous effort to precisely and consistently measure habitat characteristics, accuracy of methods for estimating which areas are used versus which are unused by birds remains generally untested. To examine accuracy of spot-mapping to identify singing territories of golden-winged warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera), which are considered an early successional forest specialists, we used spot-mapping and radiotelemetry to record song perches and delineate song territories for breeding male golden-winged warblers in northwestern Minnesota, USA We also used radiotelemetry to record locations (song and nonsong perches) of a subsample (n = 12) of males throughout the day to delineate home ranges. We found that telemetry-based estimates of song territories were 3 times larger and included more mature forest than those estimated from spot-mapping. In addition, home ranges estimated using radiotelemetry included more mature forest than spot-mapping- and telemetry-based song territories, with 75% of afternoon perches located in mature forest. Our results suggest that mature forest comprises a larger component of goldenwinged warbler song territories and home ranges than is indicated based on spot-mapping in Minnesota. Because it appears that standard observational methods can underestimate territory size and misidentify cover-type associations for golden-winged warblers, we caution that management and conservation plans may be misinformed, and that similar studies are needed for golden-winged warblers across their range and for other songbird species. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Some bat species make long-distance latitudinal migrations between summer and winter grounds, but because of their elusive nature, few aspects of their biology are well understood. The need for migratory stopover sites to rest and refuel, such as used by birds, has been repeatedly suggested, but not previously tested empirically in bats. We studied migrating silver-haired bats (Lasionycteris noctivagans) at Long Point, ON, Canada. We used digital radio-transmitters to track 30 bats using an array of five towers that effectively covered the entire region (c. 20×40km). We measured stopover duration and departure direction, and documented movement patterns, foraging activity and roost sites. We measured body composition on arrival using quantitative magnetic resonance and simulated long-distance migration using observed body composition to predict migration range and rate. Migration occurred in two waves (late August and mid-September). Most bats stayed 1-2days, although two remained >2weeks. One third of the bats foraged while at the site, many foraging opportunistically on nights when rain precluded continued migration. Bats roosted in a variety of tree species and manmade structures in natural and developed areas. Half of the bats departed across Lake Erie (minimum crossing distance c. 38km) while half departed along the shoreline. Simulations predicted a migration rate of c. 250-275km per day and suggest that all but one of the bats in our study carried sufficient fuel stores to reach the putative wintering area (estimated distance 1500km) without further refuelling. Our results suggest that migrating bats stopover for sanctuary or short-term rest as opposed to extended rest and refuelling as in many songbirds. Daily torpor could reduce energy costs when not in flight, minimizing the need for extended stopovers and allowing bats to potentially complete their migration at a fraction of the time and energy cost of similar sized birds. © 2011 The Authors.

abstract={Federal migratory bird bands have been inscribed with a postal address and toll-free telephone number (toll-free bands) since 1995 for their reporting, but in 2007 the postal mail address was replaced with an internet address (web-address bands). The reporting rate of web-address bands is unknown, and knowledge of band reporting probabilities is an integral part of bird band-recovery studies designed to obtain unbiased estimates of harvest rates and recovery rates if use of band types differs across space and time. We estimated web-address band reporting probabilities for mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) in the United States by comparing the relative recovery rate (ratio) of web-address to toll-free bands and applying this as an adjustment factor to the known reporting probabilities of toll-free bands. Cooperators banded 132,386 doves representing 57,982 (44%) web-address and 74,404 (56%) toll-free bands in July and August during 2008-2010 across 34 states, 12 regions, and 3 management units. Of the birds banded, 4,642 (3.5%) were direct recoveries, as a result of being shot, and all but 3 were reported via telephone or internet. Nationally, internet reporting accounted for 16.3% of toll-free bands and 42.9% of web-address bands recovered. Web-address bands had a greater recovery rate than toll-free bands (ratio=1.081, SE=0.027). We found some evidence of spatial variation in ratio estimates at management unit and regional scales, but the variation was primarily at the regional level where it was not great (range=1.015-1.213) and statistical support for this variation was not particularly strong (SE=0.129). Nationally, the web-address band reporting probability was 0.535 (SE=0.021), an absolute increase of 0.040 compared to the reporting probability of toll-free bands. The additional reporting probability of web-address bands relative to toll-free bands must be accounted for in band-recovery studies used to obtain estimates of harvest rates and recovery rates if use of band types differs across space and time for mourning doves and possibly other species.

Data were available from double-tagging experiments on 111 animals representing seven marine species including 4 sharks, 2 birds and 1 pinniped. Study animals carried electronic tags that provided geolocation estimates as well as more precise satellite-based location data (Argos and Global Positioning System). 4.Estimates of the precision of geolocations were similar to previous findings. The overall estimated SD of geolocation errors for each species ranged from 0·5 to 3·9° for longitude and 0·8 to 3·6° for latitude. 5.While these results are specific to this particular type of location estimation method, the state-space framework presented here is a robust approach to estimating the precision of various types of telemetry location data from double-tagging experiments.

abstract={Many birds do not breed in the year(s) immediately following independence from parental care. Instead, they spend time as immatures attaining adult plumage and spend time as floaters searching for an opportunity to breed. Floaters are nonbreeding adults. Survival during this period often is poorly understood because immatures and floaters can be secretive and range widely, making them difficult to track. From July 2006 through March 2009, we used radio-tracking data collected by aerial telemetry to estimate survival of 58 nonbreeding Crested Caracaras (Caracara cheriway). Based on an information-theoretic approach, the best-supported models indicated differences in monthly survival, which was lowest (0.953) during the peak of breeding (December-January), slightly higher (0.984) during the remainder of the breeding season (October, November, February, March), and highest (0.995) during the nonbreeding season (April-September). We identified life stage as juvenile, immature, or floater on the basis of plumage. We found no effect of sex or life stage on monthly or annual survival, and annual survival was intermediate (0.826) between existing estimates for breeding caracaras (0.876 for males and 0.906 for females) and the dependent juveniles (0.694) of breeding caracaras. None of the birds we tracked nested during our 33-month study. Our findings provide unique insight into reduced survival of nonbreeding individuals during the period when the remainder of the population breeds, and the long-term persistence of individual floaters supports the assertion of previous authors that all breeding habitat is occupied. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2012.},

abstract={Band recoveries provide requisite data for evaluating the spatial distribution of harvest relative to the distribution of breeding stocks for a wide variety of migratory species. We used direct and indirect band-recovery data to evaluate the distribution and derivation of harvest of white-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica) banded before hunting season in 3 distinct strata in Texas, USA, during 2007-2010. We banded 60,742 white-winged doves during 2007-2010, and based on 2,458 harvest recoveries, the majority (>95%) of white-winged dove harvest occurred during the first 2 months of the hunting season (Sep-Oct). Juvenile white-winged doves represented a greater percentage of the direct recoveries than adults across all strata (north = 80%, central = 69%, south = 82%) and the majority of direct band recoveries (north = 75%, central = 90%, south = 78%) occurred within the original banding strata. Age-specific weighting factors and harvest derivation indicated that both juvenile and adult harvest were highest within the strata of original banding. Harvest distribution data corrected for band-reporting rates indicated high fidelity of white-winged doves to specific geographic strata, with little interplay between strata. Our results suggest that population vital-rate estimates for survival and harvest for use in future Adaptive Harvest Management should focus on stock-specific levels. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) were one of the upper-trophic-level avian predators on the Channel Islands, California, prior to their extirpation by 1960 caused in part by large amounts of DDT discharged into the Southern California Bight. From 2002 to 2006, 61 Bald Eagles were reintroduced onto the northern Channel Islands, as part of a 5-yr feasibility study conducted under the auspices of the Montrose Settlement Restoration Program. In December 2005, a yearling Bald Eagle female was found on Santa Rosa Island with a broken wing and elevated lead levels in her blood of 52.2 ug/dl (0.522 ppm). This incident raised concerns that lead poisoning could be a potential threat to the restoration effort and prompted further investigation. Femurs from five female and two male Bald Eagles reintroduced to the northern Channel Islands were collected postmortem for analyses of lead and other metals. Lead levels detected in femurs of these birds ranged from 0.2 to 55.0 ppm (dry weight). Lead levels in liver were also determined for two of the seven Bald Eagles. Analysis of Bald Eagle movement data from satellite telemetry transmitters suggested that eagles that spent the most time on Santa Rosa Island had the highest lead levels. The results of this study suggested that spent ammunition containing lead found in carrion (offal and entire carcasses) from deer and elk hunting on Santa Rosa Island may have been a primary source of contamination.

abstract={There has been widespread speculation that breeding activity places adult female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) at heightened risk of harvest due to insufficient time to complete the wing molt or recover body condition prior to onset of hunting and autumn migration. We tested the hypotheses that breeding females have higher rates of harvest and reduced prospects for survival by estimating band recovery rates (f ) and annual survival (S) in relation to individual measures of breeding effort for 3,055 adult female mallards that had been banded and radiomarked during the breeding season in the Prairie-Parkland Region of Canada, 1993-2000. Birds that had been marked with external prong-and-suture transmitters had lower estimated survival rates (S = 0.518, SE = 0.118) than birds marked with implant transmitters (S = 0.731, SE = 0.061), but rates for birds marked with implant transmitters did not differ from expectations based on other studies for females marked only with legbands. After excluding external transmitters, we found that recovery rates were unaffected by any measures of reproductive effort, but annual survival was lower for females that tended broods to 60 days of age (S = 0.474 ± 0.115) versus females that never hatched a nest (S = 0.654 ± 0.042). Telemetry data indicated that brood-rearing females experienced extremely low mortality, so reduced survival of females that raised broods presumably resulted from insufficient time to molt and prepare for autumn migration. Management efforts that promote successful early nesting attempts may also improve adult female survival by allowing females more time to molt and prepare for autumn migration, whereas hunting regulations designed to protect late-breeding females may prove ineffective if such individuals have higher natural mortality. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Animals can require different habitat types throughout their annual cycles. When considering habitat prioritization, we need to explicitly consider habitat requirements throughout the annual cycle, particularly for species of conservation concern. Understanding annual habitat requirements begins with quantifying how far individuals move across landscapes between key life stages to access required habitats. We quantified individual interseasonal movements for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; hereafter sage-grouse) using radio-telemetry spanning the majority of the species distribution in Wyoming. Sage-grouse are currently a candidate for listing under the United States Endangered Species Act and Wyoming is predicted to remain a stronghold for the species. Sage-grouse use distinct seasonal habitats throughout their annual cycle for breeding, brood rearing, and wintering. Average movement distances in Wyoming from nest sites to summer-late brood-rearing locations were 8.1 km (SE = 0.3 km; n = 828 individuals) and the average subsequent distances moved from summer sites to winter locations were 17.3 km (SE = 0.5 km; n = 607 individuals). Average nest-to-winter movements were 14.4 km (SE = 0.6 km; n = 434 individuals). We documented remarkable variation in the extent of movement distances both within and among sites across Wyoming, with some individuals remaining year-round in the same vicinity and others moving over 50 km between life stages. Our results suggest defining any of our populations as migratory or non-migratory is innappropriate as individual strategies vary widely. We compared movement distances of birds marked using Global Positioning System (GPS) and very high frequency (VHF) radio marking techniques and found no evidence that the heavier GPS radios limited movement. Furthermore, we examined the capacity of the sage-grouse core regions concept to capture seasonal locations. As expected, we found the core regions approach, which was developed based on lek data, was generally better at capturing the nesting locations than summer or winter locations. However, across Wyoming the sage-grouse breeding core regions still contained a relatively high percentage of summer and winter locations and seem to be a reasonable surrogate for non-breeding habitat when no other information exists. We suggest that conservation efforts for greater sage-grouse implicitly incorporate seasonal habitat needs because of high variation in the amount of overlap among breeding core regions and non-breeding habitat.

abstract={Spring harvest is a primary mortality factor for male eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris), but the relationship between spring harvest regimes and annual survival is not well understood. We banded 462 male wild turkeys from 1989 to 2007 in southeastern Louisiana to estimate annual survival and band recovery rates relative to spring harvest. We evaluated these parameters under a liberal harvest season (3-bird limit; 1989-1997) and a reduced conservative harvest season (2-bird limit; 2000-2007). Estimated recovery rates during the liberal season were 0.75 (SE = 0.05) for adults and 0.63 (SE = 0.04) for juveniles, and recovery rates during the conservative season were 0.61 (SE = 0.04) and 0.48 (SE = 0.05) for adults and juveniles, respectively. Annual survival averaged 0.16 (SE = 0.05) and 0.43 (SE = 0.05) for adults and juveniles, respectively, during the liberal season. Conversely, during the conservative season, annual survival averaged 0.31 (SE = 0.05) and 0.56 (SE = 0.05) for adults and juveniles, respectively. Our findings suggest that bag limit reductions combined with a reduction in season length contributed to a 2-fold increase in annual survival for male wild turkeys. We contend that male wild turkeys were likely over harvested on our study area during the liberal harvest season, which contributed to exceptionally low annual survival rates. Managers should attempt to assess survival rates of male wild turkeys in harvested populations to properly manage spring harvest and develop appropriate harvest limits.

abstract={Management of migratory birds at the national level has historically relied on regulatory boundaries for definition of harvest restrictions and estimation of demographic parameters. Most species of migratory game birds are not expanding their ranges, so migratory corridors are approximately fixed. White-winged doves (Zenaida asiatica), however, have undergone significant variation in population structure with marked range expansion occurring in Texas, and range contraction in Arizona, during the last 30 years. Because >85% of white-winged dove harvest in the United States (approx. 1.3 million annually) now occurs in Texas, information on vital rates of expanding white-winged dove populations is necessary for informed management. We used band recovery and mark-recapture data to investigate variation in survival and harvest across 3 geographic strata for white-winged doves banded in the pre-hunting season in Texas during 2007-2010. We banded 60,742 white-winged doves, recovered 2,458 bands via harvest reporting, and recaptured 455 known-age birds between 2007 and 2010. The best supporting model found some evidence for geographic differences in survival rates among strata (A-C) in both hatch-year (juvenile; A = 0.205 [SE = 0.0476], B = 0.213 [SE = 0.0278], C = 0.364 [SE = 0.0254]) and after-hatch year (adult; A = 0.483 [SE = 0.0775], B = 0.465 [SE = 0.0366], C = 0.538 [SE = 0.251]) birds. White-winged doves had a low probability of moving among strata (0.009) or being recaptured (0.002) across all strata. Harvest recovery rates were concordant with estimates for other dove species, but were variable across geographic strata. Based on our results, harvest management strategies for white-winged doves in Texas and elsewhere should consider differences in population vital rates among geographic strata. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={The ecology of migratory landbirds in Baja California has been little studied, yet the nonbreeding season is of critical importance in the life cycle of any bird. We used mist netting to quantify the relative abundance and demographic indices of six species of landbirds wintering in riparian habitat at two sites in Baja California. In addition, we assessed their persistence at the sites through area searches for and recapture of individuals marked with a unique combination of color bands. From the winter of 2004-05 through the winter of 2006-07 we captured 561 individuals of the six species along the Río Santo Tomás and Rio San Vicente. The most abundant species, the Hermit Thrush (Catharus guttatus), Yellow-rumped Warbler [Setophaga coronata), and Ruby-crowned Kinglet (Regulus calendula), together accounted for 83.1% of all net captures of target species. The sex ratios of the six target species were not significantly different from 1:1 except for the Yellow-rumped Warbler, of which we found significantly more males than females. Persistence beyond one day and annual rates of return of the color-banded target species were generally low and did not differ by sex.},

abstract={Colored neckbands are known to reduce survival rates of geese, but the underlying cause for lower survival is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that hunters cause this lower survival rate by actively targeting neckbanded geese. We evaluated this hypothesis by estimating recovery and survival rates of adult Ross's geese (Chen rossii) at both Queen Maud Gulf (QMG) and McConnell River (MCR) Migratory Bird Sanctuaries carrying each of 3 marker combinations: 1) standard legbands (n=11,321) for basic estimates of recovery and survival rates; 2) standard legbands and colored neckbands (n=8,587) as the marked sample most detectable and thus most vulnerable to targeting by hunters; and 3) standard legbands and white neckbands (n=6,501) as the sample exposed to the general risks of carrying neckbands but only minimally detectable by hunters, if at all. Recovery rates (±95% CL) of Ross's geese were lowest for those marked with legbands (0.024±0.004 at MCR and 0.016±0.003 at QMG) and highest for those marked with neckbands, regardless of neckband color (0.042±0.005 at MCR and 0.035±0.005 at QMG). Survival rates (±95% CL) were indistinguishable between geese marked with color and white neckbands (0.54±0.08 at MCR and 0.52±0.08 at QMG), but lower than those marked with standard legbands only (0.72±0.17 at MCR and 0.83±0.23 at QMG). Geese marked with white neckbands were recovered at rates similar to those marked with color neckbands, suggesting that hunter selection of color neckbands did not contribute greatly to lower survival rates in neckbanded geese. Rather, results suggest that neckbanded geese, regardless of neckband visibility, are more vulnerable to hunters than are geese marked only with legbands. © 2012 The Wildlife Society.

abstract={We investigated the movement ecology of Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) that winter along the Upper Mississippi River Valley. During late autumn and winter from March 1999 through February 2006, we outfitted with satellite transmitters 14 wild-caught Bald Eagles (12 adults, 2 subadults) on a winter range or migration stopover point in southwestern Wisconsin. These birds wintered as far south as the Mississippi and Illinois rivers, northwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Summer ranges extended out from the Upper Mississippi River Valley migration corridor as far north as Arviat, Nunavut, Canada, on the western shore of Hudson Bay. Migration route fidelity was apparent, with two notable exceptions. Fidelity to summer and winter ranges also was apparent, but variable. Some eagles remained on a small range the entire season; others traveled extensively, often to the same areas in successive years. Spring migration mean start and end dates for adults were 24 February ± 23 (SD) d and 27 April ± 40 d, respectively. Eagles took from 6151 d to reach their summer ranges (mean: 67 ± 48 d). Mean start and end dates for autumn migration were 21 October ± 28 d and 11 December ± 16 d, respectively; travel duration ranged from 1577 d (mean: 51 ± 20 d). Individual mean straight-line distances between core winter and summer ranges ranged from 6112222 km (mean: 1655 ± 526 km). Our study provided new information on Bald Eagle movement ecology in a vast region where such knowledge was previously lacking. Compared to other tracking studies of Bald Eagles, our study documented greater variation in migration timing and duration, but similar range and route fidelity and distances traveled. © 2012 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={To better understand how birds balance the demands of reproduction and food-provisioning, Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula) were studied from May-July 2009 and 2010 in a mixed-species colony in Wichita, Kansas. Observations included 68 h of scan samples at 34 nests which yielded >11,000 instantaneous records; the durations of 57 food-provisioning trips made by eight radio-tagged birds; 73 records of foraging locations, and 27 h of foraging activity and aggressive intraspecific interactions. Adult activities at the nest included sitting (41% of the time), standing (18%), preening (10%), nest maintenance (7%) and feeding chicks (<1%). Incubating adults spent significantly more time sitting but less time standing than did adults with chicks. The amount of time that both parents were away from the nest increased significantly with chick age. Multiple regression analysis with AIC modeling showed that Julian date, chick stage, and year were important predictor variables in nest activity patterns. Mean food-provisioning intervals (242 ±22 min; range = 52-539 min) differed among radio-tagged birds, but did not differ by time of day or date. Round-trip flight distances averaged 16.1 ±3.2 km (range = 6-49 km), and also differed among birds. Distances to foraging sites were combined with published energetic values to estimate flight costs. Compared with birds that used distant foraging sites (>18 km from the colony), birds that used sites near the colony (<3 km) had higher capture efficiencies but caught smaller prey, had much higher rates of aggression, and lower rates of energy intake.},

abstract={Wind power is a fast-growing industry with broad potential to impact volant wildlife. Flight altitude is a key determinant of the risk to wildlife from modern horizontal-axis wind turbines, which typically have a rotor-swept zone of 50-150 m above the ground. We used altitudinal GPS data collected from golden eagles Aquila chrysaetos tracked using satellite telemetry to evaluate the potential impacts of wind turbines on eagles and other raptors along migratory routes. Eagle movements during migration were classified as local (1-5 km h -1) or migratory (&gt;10 km h -1) and were characterized based on the type of terrain over which each bird was flying, and the bird's distance from wind resources preferred for energy development. Birds engaged in local movements turned more frequently and flew at lower altitude than during active migration. This flight behaviour potentially exposes them to greater risk of collision with turbines than when engaged in longer-distance movements. Eagles flew at relatively lower altitude over steep slopes and cliffs (sites where orographic lift can develop) than over flats and gentle slopes (sites where thermal lift is more likely). Eagles predominantly flew near to wind resources preferred by energy developers, and locally moving eagles flew closer to those wind resources with greater frequency than eagles in active migration. Synthesis and applications. Our research outlines the general effects of topography on raptor flight altitude and demonstrates how topography can interact with raptor migration behaviour to drive a potential human-wildlife conflict resulting from wind energy development. Management of risk to migratory species from industrial-scale wind turbines should consider the behavioural differences between both locally moving and actively migrating individuals. Additionally, risk assessment for wind energy-wildlife interactions should incorporate the consequences of topography on the flight altitude of potentially impacted wildlife. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Soaring birds that undertake long-distance migration should develop strategies to minimize the energetic costs of endurance flight. This is relevant because condition upon completion of migration has direct consequences for fecundity, fitness and thus, demography. Therefore, strong evolutionary pressures are expected for energy minimization tactics linked to weather and topography. Importantly, the minute-by-minute mechanisms birds use to subsidize migration in variable weather are largely unknown, in large part because of the technological limitations in studying detailed long-distance bird flight. Here, we show golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) migratory response to changing meteorological conditions as monitored by high-resolution telemetry. In contrast to expectations, responses to meteorological variability were stereotyped across the 10 individuals studied. Eagles reacted to increased wind speed by using more orographic lift and less thermal lift. Concomitantly, as use of thermals decreased, variation in flight speed and altitude also decreased. These results demonstrate how soaring migrant birds can minimize energetic expenditures, they show the context for avian decisions and choices of specific instantaneous flight mechanisms and they have important implications for design of bird-friendly wind energy. © 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract={Determining the importance of stopover and staging areas to migrating shorebirds (Aves: Charadriiformes) is essential if such habitats are to be successfully protected. Migration chronology, species composition, length of stay, body condition, and estimated total abundance of shorebirds during spring and fall migratory periods of 2008 and 2009 were documented on Akimiski Island, Nunavut, Canada. Fourteen shorebird species were observed during spring point counts and 18 during fall. Semipalmated (Calidris pusilla) and White-rumped (C. fuscicollis) Sandpipers comprised about 80 % of all individuals observed. A greater number of species and individuals were observed during fall than spring in both years. Radio-transmitters attached to juvenile Semipalmated and Least (C. minutilla) Sandpipers indicated highly variable lengths of stay ranging up to 26 days in both species (Semipalmated Sandpiper averaged 6.5 ± 2.67 days, n = 12; Least Sandpipers averaged 7.25 ± 3.79 days, n = 8). In 2009, Semipalmated Sandpipers captured and weighed later in the season were significantly heavier than those captured earlier suggesting that this species is refueling while on Akimiski Island. A fall migration seasonal density of 5,267 (2,193-8,341) shorebirds/km 2 was estimated given a residence probability (i. e., the probability of an individual being present in consecutive counts) of 0.906 ± 0.181. Assuming similar habitat value and shorebird density, an extrapolation of the seasonal plot density of 5,267 birds/km 2 to the total 192 km 2 mudflat habitat on Akimiski Island yields an estimate of 1,011,264 (421,098-1,601,429) shorebirds during fall migration, making Akimiski Island of Hemispheric importance as a staging site for migrant arctic-breeding shorebirds. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract={Designation of an effective marine protected area (MPA) requires substantial knowledge of the spatial use of the region by key species, particularly those of high mobility. Within the Ross Sea, Antarctica, the least altered marine ecosystem on Earth, unusually large and closely interacting populations of several marine bird and mammal species co-exist. Understanding how that is possible is important to maintaining the ecological integrity of the system, the major goal in designating the Ross Sea as an MPA. We report analyses of niche occupation, two-dimensional habitat use, and overlap for the majority (9) of mesopredator species in the Ross Sea considering three components: (1) diet, (2) vertical distribution and (3) horizontal distribution. For (1) and (2) we used information in the literature; for (3) we used maximum entropy modeling to project species' distributions from occurrence data from several ocean cruises and satellite telemetry, correlated with six environmental variables. Results identified and ranked areas of importance in a conservation prioritization framework. While diet overlapped intensively, some spatial partitioning existed in the vertical dimension (diving depth). Horizontal partitioning, however, was the key structuring factor, defined by three general patterns of environmental suitability: (1) continental shelf break, (2) shelf and slope, and (3) marginal ice zone of the pack ice surrounding the Ross Sea post-polynya. In aggregate, the nine mesopredators used the entire continental shelf and slope, allowing the large populations of these species to co-exist. Conservation prioritization analyses identified the outer shelf and slope and the deeper troughs in the Ross Sea shelf to be most important. Our results substantially improve understanding of these species' niche occupation and imply that a piecemeal approach to MPA designation in this system is not likely to be successful. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={We describe new methods for quantifying specific in-situ activities of wildlife, in this case the endangered Cali-fornia condor (Gymnogyps californianus). These methods extract information from hundreds of thousands of temporally continuous and spatially explicit satellite telemetry reports. Visual observations and ground-based telemetry can provide behavioral data, although the information is often spatially and temporally limited and sample sizes can be small for wide-ranging species. Automated satellite telemetry offers continuous position reporting and unbiased spatial coverage, but to date has lacked thematic content such as the time, place, and duration of particular activities. Procedures developed for this study use a combination of models and geographic information systems (GIS) to identify condor transit flight, perching, roosting, and nesting activity based only on hourly telemetry position reports. This approach combines the temporal and spatial advantages of automated telemetry with increased thematic quality from activity models. The analytical methods were applied to 340,694 satellite-based position records from 51 California condors which were collected from June 2005 to April 2012. We identified 31,268 extended perch locations and an additional 15,483 overnight roost locations by translating basic location, speed, and time data into characterizations of bird activities. This approach correctly identified nine of the ten known nest sites occupied by condors outfitted with telemetry transmitters based only on the telemetry da-ta. The spatial locations of these activities were mapped using GIS. This represents a significant advantage over simple location and movement data normally associated with wildlife telemetry, and is applicable to a wide range of species. © Cogan et al.},

abstract={We monitored site-use and movements of 102 radio-tagged European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) during the winter months at 2 concentrated animal feeding operations (feedlots) in central Kansas. Our research investigated the spatial ecology of wintering starlings as part of a broad epidemiological study on the possible role of starlings in pathogen transmission at feedlots. Site fidelity was 0.677 and 0.552 (days at capture-site per total days tagged) for feedlots A and B, respectively. Minimal exchange (9%) occurred between feedlots A and B and was often followed by a roost-site change. Starlings rarely abandoned the feedlot where they were captured, but we observed 41 (40%) birds that temporarily switched allegiance from their capture sites to other feedlots; the farthest bird was detected 68 km from the capture site. We speculate that the limited frequency of time spent at non-capture-site feedlots could lower the potential for risk of starlings spreading pathogens among feedlots. We suggest management strategies within the feedlot that may reduce starling populations and speculate that this would lower the risk of spreading pathogens among feedlots.},

abstract={1. Radiotelemetry provides a tool for monitoring animals that are difficult to observe directly. Recent technical advances have given rise to new systems that present expanded opportunities for field research. We report the results of the first field test of Encounternet, a new digital radiotelemetry system comprising portable receiver stations and digital tags designed for long-term studies of the social behaviour and ecology of free-living animals. 2. We present results from a series of field tests designed to evaluate the utility of Encounternet for monitoring animals in a neotropical forest, with an emphasis on evaluating mate sampling behaviour in female long-tailed manakins. In this tropical species, females visit leks where males perform elaborate dances on horizontal perches. Females are highly cryptic in both plumage and activities, and therefore, Encounternet might provide unique insights into female behaviour and ecology. 3. Our first two tests revealed that pulse strength and probability of detection decrease with the distance between tag and receiver and that tags placed on a fixed perch near a receiver showed different patterns of reception than more distant tags. Our third test revealed that antenna angle had only a small influence on pulse strength. 4. Blind analysis of simulated bird movements confirmed that the Encounternet system provides reliable information on animal activity. Data from multiple receivers permitted accurate reconstruction of simulated bird movements. Tag detections showed low levels of false negatives and false positives. 5. Female manakins responded well to carrying Encounternet tags attached by an elastic leg harness. Birds flew well upon release and were detected for 7.5 ± 0.8 days after release. Recaptures and re-sightings of females were rare in our large study population, yet there were two occasions where we confirmed that the tag fell off within 1 year. 6. We conclude that Encounternet technology provides an effective tool for monitoring animal ecology and behaviour. We show that it is capable of providing accurate measures of distance and that it is a highly versatile system for studying the ecology and behaviour of free-living animals. We discuss the unique opportunities facilitated by this technology for future ecological and behavioural studies. © 2012 The Authors.

abstract={Banding records were examined to identify changes in mortality causes and locations of Double-crested Cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus) in Door County, Wisconsin. In 14 out of 18 years between 1988 and 2005, a total of 22,469 birds were banded (300 to 5,462; average 1,605 per active banding year). Of 649 usable band returns (36.1 ± 5.4 per year), 33% were banding-year recoveries (before 1 May of the first year of life). The yearly rate of banding-year recoveries increased from 0.7% per year before 1996 to 2.2% per year after 1999. The yearly proportion of all band recoveries attributed to animal damage control operations also increased over time. The yearly proportion of band returns from Mississippi Delta states increased over time. Mortality rates, both natural and anthropogenic, of cormorants from these colonies appear to have risen as the population has grown and control activities in southern states have increased. Apparent survival rates were estimated by mark-recapture methods during 2001 to 2006. Birds color-banded as adults had a model-averaged annual survival rate of 0.696. For birds banded as nestlings, the model-averaged survival rates were: 0.305 (first year), 0.774 (second and third year), and 0.633 (adults). Simulations of these measured survival rates combined with previously estimated reproductive rates demonstrated that emigration and immigration rates complicate interpretation of these results. Also, simulations demonstrate the potential efficacy of reproductive controls in reducing local breeding populations.},

abstract={Managing pine (Pinus spp.) savanna through frequent use of prescribed fire and selective harvest of off-site hardwoods in the uplands is appropriate for many declining wildlife species, but may be incompatible with published recommendations for wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo). Therefore, we investigated breeding season habitat use of radio-tagged wild turkeys (n= 78) in a frequently burned pine savanna system in southwest Georgia during 2003-2005. Ground story vegetation structure and composition in pine savannas change rapidly following fire such that categorical (i.e., burned vs. unburned) habitat selection analyses does not depict the fine scaled time-dependent relationships; therefore, we analyzed turkey selection of savanna on a seasonal and continuous scale. From a seasonal standpoint, pine savanna habitat-type were selected by gobblers, but used less than availability by hens. However, selection of pine savanna was influenced by time since fire; hens more likely selected pine savannas burned within 1.4. years whereas gobblers selected pine savannas burned within 1.6. years. Hens also selected hardwood drains whereas gobblers demonstrated proportional use of these habitats. Selection of pine savannas by wild turkeys was dependent on application of prescribed burning <2. years and suggests that previous recommendations for longer burning frequencies are too long to balance turkey habitat needs with those of a suite of declining birds associated with pine savanna ecosystems. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Harvest management of Canada geese Branta canadensis is complicated by the fact that temperate- and subarctic-breeding geese occur in many of the same areas during fall and winter hunting seasons. These populations cannot readily be distinguished, thereby complicating efforts to estimate population-specific harvest and evaluate harvest strategies. In the Atlantic Flyway, annual banding and population monitoring programs are in place for subarctic-breeding (North Atlantic Population, Southern James Bay Population, and Atlantic Population) and temperate- breeding (Atlantic Flyway Resident Population [AFRP]) Canada geese. We used a combination of direct band recoveries and estimated population sizes to determine the distribution and derivation of the harvest of those four populations during the 2004-2005 through 2008-2009 hunting seasons. Most AFRP geese were harvested during the special September season (42%) and regular season (54%) and were primarily taken in the state or province in which they were banded. Nearly all of the special season harvest was AFRP birds: 98% during September seasons and 89% during late seasons. The regular season harvest in Atlantic Flyway states was also primarily AFRP geese (62%), followed in importance by the Atlantic Population (33%). In contrast, harvest in eastern Canada consisted mainly of subarctic geese (42% Atlantic Population, 17% North Atlantic Population, and 6% Southern James Bay Population), with temperate-breeding geese making up the rest. Spring and summer harvest was difficult to characterize because band reporting rates for subsistence hunters are poorly understood; consequently, we were unable to determine the magnitude of subsistence harvest definitively. A better understanding of subsistence hunting is needed because this activity may account for a substantial proportion of the total harvest of subarctic populations. Our results indicate that special September and late seasons in the United States were highly effective in targeting AFRP geese without significantly increasing harvest of subarctic populations. However, it is evident that AFRP geese still are not being harvested at levels high enough to reduce their numbers to the breeding population goal of 700,000.},

abstract={The Purple Finch (Carpodacus purpureus (Gmelin)) is a migratory fringillid breeding across the northern co-niferous forests of North America. Although irruptions occur, little information has been gathered on the movements of individual birds. We used the 19,893 re-encounters of banded birds in the Bird Banding Laboratory database to identify patterns of movements and to examine wintering and breeding site fidelity. After normalizing the data for banding effort, we found that birds banded in the northeastern United States tended to move along the Atlantic Seaboard. Most birds banded in the upper Mid-west also moved along a north-south axis. Purple Finches west of the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Mountains in the far west rarely move east of those mountains. Throughout the range of the species, most movements tend to be along the north-south axis. The re-encounter data indicated a strong level of breeding site and wintering site fidelity with evidence of some year-round fidelity. Analysis of re-encounters as a function of season of banding and season of re-encounter demonstrated that birds stayed close to their breeding grounds during the fall before leaving for their wintering areas. Birds departed from the wintering areas early in the spring. © Wilson and Brown.},

abstract={Investigating the potential effects of handling and marking techniques on study animals is important for correct interpretation of research results and to effect progress in data-collection methods. Few investigators have compared the reproductive output of radio-tagged and non-radio-tagged songbirds, and no one to date has examined the possible effect of radio-tagging adult songbirds on the survival of their fledglings. In 2011 and 2012, we compared several parameters of reproductive output of two groups of female Golden-winged Warblers (Vermivora chrysoptera) breeding in Minnesota, including 45 females with radio-transmitters and 73 females we did not capture, handle, or mark. We found no difference between groups in clutch sizes, hatching success, brood sizes, length of incubation and nestling stages, fledging success, number of fledglings, or survival of fledglings to independence. Thus, radio-tags had no measurable impact on the productivity of female Golden-winged Warblers. Our results build upon previous studies where investigators have reported no effects of radio-tagging on the breeding parameters of songbirds by also demonstrating no effect of radio-tagging through the post-fledging period and, therefore, the entire breeding season. © 2013 The Authors. © 2013 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Markers are widely used to study behavior, migration, and the life history traits of birds such as survival, dispersal, and reproductive success. The presence of neck collars has been shown to impact the breeding propensity of adult female Greater Snow Geese (Chen caerulescens atlantica), but not their survival rates. We evaluated the hypothesis that the reduction in breeding propensity in neck-collared birds was due to a reduction in the body condition of these long-distance migrants that rely on a partial capital breeding strategy. Our study was conducted during 4 consecutive years along the St. Lawrence estuary in Quebec, Canada, a major spring staging area for these geese. We captured and marked 2552 geese with collars and 34 were recaptured in subsequent years at the same site. After controlling for confounding variables such as year and date of capture, we found that the presence of a neck collar reduced body condition of females during spring staging. Female Greater Snow Geese lost an average of 105.5 ± 39.1 (SE) g (4% of body mass) after carrying a collar for 1 yr and an average of 81.9 ± 43.6 g compared to original mass when recaptured 2 or 3 yr later. Our results suggest that the previously reported reduction in breeding propensity of neck-collared geese may be due to a reduction in body condition during spring staging. Neck collars could negatively affect the body condition of female Greater Snow Geese by increasing their energy expenditure (due to increased drag during flight or to chronic stress) or reducing their foraging efficiency. © 2013 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Food-value theory states that territorial animals space themselves such that each territory contains adequate food for rearing young. The ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) is often cited as a species for which this hypothesis is supported because ovenbird territory size is inversely related to ground-invertebrate abundance within territories. However, little is known about juvenile ovenbird diet and whether food availability is accurately assessed using ground-sampling methods. We examined the relationship between ground-litter food availability and juvenile ovenbird diet in mixed northern hardwood-coniferous forests of north-central Minnesota. We sampled food availability with pitfall traps and litter samples, and concurrently sampled diet of juvenile ovenbirds from stomach samples. We found that juvenile ovenbirds were fed selectively from available food resources. In addition, we found that both ground-sampling methods greatly under-sampled forest caterpillars and snails, which together comprised 63% of juvenile ovenbird diet by mass. Combined with recent radio-telemetry findings that spot-mapping methods can poorly estimate territory size for forest songbirds, our results suggest that comparisons of spot-mapped ovenbird territories with ground-sampled invertebrate availability may not be reliable tests of food-value theory. © 2013, American Midland Naturalist.},

abstract={We studied Ovenbird Seiurus aurocapilla and Golden-winged Warbler Vermivora chrysoptera populations in northern Minnesota, USA, to test two common assumptions in studies of songbird nest success: (1) that the condition of an empty nest on or near its expected fledge date is an indicator of nest fate; and (2) that the presence of a fledgling or family group within a territory confirms a successful nest in that territory. We monitored the condition of nests and used radiotelemetry to monitor juveniles through the expected fledging date and early post-fledging period. Of nests that contained nestlings 1-2 days before the expected fledge date, fates were misidentified using nest condition alone for 9.5% of Ovenbird nests, but those misidentifications were made in both directions (succeeded or failed), yielding only a small bias in estimated nest success. However, 20% of Golden-winged Warbler nests were misidentified as successful using nest condition during the final visit interval, biasing the nest success estimate upward by 21-28% depending on the treatment of uncertain nest fates. Fledgling Ovenbirds from 58% of nests travelled beyond their natal territory within 24 h, rising to 98% after 5 days, and those fledglings travelled up to 390 m from nests within 10 days of fledging. Fledgling Golden-winged Warblers from 13% of nests travelled beyond their natal territory within 24 h, rising to 85% after 5 days, and those fledglings travelled up to 510 m from nests within 10 days of fledging. We conclude that nest condition and fledgling presence can be misleading indicators of nest fate, probably commonly biasing nest success estimates upward, and we recommend that these assumptions should be tested in additional species. © 2013 British Ornithologists' Union.},

abstract={Intensive agriculture, as is typical of corn and soybean production, may be responsible for declines in the abundance and diversity of farmland birds. In Quebec, the transition to intensive crops is evidenced by marked increases of corn and soybean fields. From 2008 to 2010, we used satellite telemetry to study use of corn (Zea mays) and soybean (Glycine max) fields, other farmlands, wetlands, urban areas, and other habitats by 10 female Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) of the anatum-tundrius complex, a taxon of "special concern" in Canada. We monitored females during the nesting season, from hatching of eggs to independence of young, but before the young dispersed away from the nest site. Adult females were less likely to use corn and soybean fields than the "other farmlands" and "other habitats" categories during the nestling stage and the first month after young fledged. Once young fledged, other farmlands and urban areas were more likely to be used than the "other habitats" category when females were hunting in the areas that were farthest from the nest. The expansion of corn and soybean fields in the Quebec agricultural landscape has occurred to the detriment of other crops and may contribute to the decline in quality of hunting habitat of Peregrine Falcons and other avian top predators. © 2013 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

abstract={We used radio telemetry to monitor movements, cover-type selection, and survival for fledglings of the mature-forest nesting Ovenbird (. Seiurus aurocapilla) at two managed forest sites in north-central Minnesota. Both sites contained forested wetlands, regenerating clearcut stands of various ages, and logging roads, but differed in mature forest composition; one deciduous with open understory, and the other mixed coniferous-deciduous with dense understory. We used compositional analysis, modified to incorporate age-specific limitations in fledgling movements, to assess cover-type selection by fledglings throughout the dependent (on adult care) post-fledging period. Compared to those that were depredated, fledglings from nests in deciduous forest that survived the early post-fledging period had more older (sapling-dominated) clearcut available, directed movements toward older clearcuts and forested wetlands, and used older clearcuts more than other cover types relative to availability. Fledglings that were depredated had more young (shrub-dominated) clearcut and unpaved logging road available, and used mature forest and roads more than expected based on availability. For birds from nests in mixed mature forest with dense understory, movements and cover-type selection were similar between fledglings that survived and those that were depredated. However, fledglings that were depredated at that site also had more young clearcut available than fledglings that survived. We conclude that Ovenbird fledgling survival is influenced by distance of their nest to various non-nesting cover types, and by the subsequent selection among those cover types, but that the influence of non-nesting cover types varies depending on the availability of dense understory vegetation in mature forest. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Use of soft-metal (aluminum alloy) bands on gulls (Laridae) is known to result in high rates of band loss and, as a result, hard-metal (monel, incoloy, or stainless steel) bands are superior for most studies. However, the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory (BBL) and the Canadian Wildlife Service Bird Banding Office continue to issue soft bands for use on gulls, and the BBL does not make specific recommendations about use of hard bands so many banders continue to use soft bands. For wholly marine species of gulls banded in North America since 1996, ∼20% have been banded with soft bands; the proportion of soft bands used on partially freshwater gulls was ∼70% up to 2009, but has since fallen to 40%. Using hierarchical Bayesian models in program MARK, we analyzed recovery data for three gull species and found that estimates of annual survival rates derived from soft bands (0.68-0.81) were lower than those derived from hard bands (0.85-0.96). Comparison of survival rates of Herring Gulls (Larus argentatus) in the Great Lakes basin and on the Atlantic coast provided no evidence that soft bands last longer in freshwater than saltwater. Band loss compromises many types of studies, including those assessing the possible effects of climate change. We recommend that use of soft bands on gulls be discontinued, and that banders be required to use hard bands on these species in the future. The same consideration applies to other long-lived species, including some waterfowl and all albatrosses, pelicans, cormorants, shearwaters, petrels, terns, shorebirds, and alcids. Use of hard bands should be based on expectations about a species' longevity and evidence of band wear, rather than on whether or not it occurs in saltwater. © 2013 The Authors.

abstract={While the breeding and wintering ranges of the eastern population of Barrow's Goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica) are generally described, molting locations and links among breeding, molting, and wintering areas are unclear, particularly for adult females. Incubating females from the same breeding location (n = 5) were equipped with satellite transmitters in June 2009. Four molting sites were identified over 2 years, spread broadly across Québec: an inlet in Ungava Bay 1,100 km from the breeding area, a lake 100 km south of Ungava Bay (880 km from breeding area), a lake near Hudson Bay (910 km from breeding area) and the mouth of the Rivière aux Outardes River in the St. Lawrence Estuary (165 km from breeding area). The distance between molting females averaged 755 km and two females molted in regions where males were known to molt. Of four birds with consecutive years of molt locations, three showed inter-annual fidelity to within 5 km of the previous molt sites and the fourth molted in sites that were 968 km apart. Females wintered in different locations within the St. Lawrence Estuary and moved widely throughout the area during winter. The south coast of the St. Lawrence Estuary was used during spring and fall staging, and the north coast during winter. There was not strong migratory connectivity among annual cycle stages in eastern adult female Barrow's Goldeneyes, indicating that they should be considered a single management unit that occurs over a broad range throughout the year.},

Satellite transmitters were fitted to eight Canada Geese at Santee National Wildlife Refuge during the winter of 2009-2010. Canada Geese departed Santee National Wildlife Refuge between 5 and 7 March 2010. Six Canada Geese followed a route that included stopovers in northeastern North Carolina and western New york, with three of those birds completing spring migration to breeding grounds associated with the atlantic Population (aP). the mean distance between stopover sites along this route was 417 km, the mean total migration distance was 2838 km, and the Canada Geese arrived on aP breeding grounds on the eastern shore of hudson bay between 20 and 24 May 2010. two Canada Geese followed a different route from that described above, with stopovers in northeastern ohio, prior to arriving on the breeding grounds on 9 June 2010. Mean distance between stopover sites was 402 and 365 km for these two birds, and total migration distance was 4020 and 3650 km. these data represent the first efforts to track migratory Canada geese from the southernmost extent of their current wintering range in the atlantic Flyway. We did not track any Canada Geese to breeding grounds associated with the Southern James bay Population. Caution should be used in the interpretation of this finding, however, because of the small sample size. We demonstrated that migratory Canada Geese wintering in South Carolina use at least two migratory pathways and that an affiliation with the atlantic Population breeding ground exists.},

All 12 birds spent the winter in Mexico, north of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. Eleven of the birds went to the Jalisco region in western Mexico, but two of those birds (18% of total) moved east in midwinter to either the Sierra Madre Oriental or Sierra Madre del Sur; the 12th bird went directly to one of the latter regions. The return rate over the next 2 years for tagged birds (34%) was not statistically lower than that for control birds (45%). We combined our results with the results of an earlier study that used geolocators on Swainson's Thrushes from British Columbia to quantify the strength of migratory connectivity using Mantel's correlation coefficient. Our estimate of the strength of migratory connectivity for Swainson's Thrushes (rm = 0.72) was much stronger than that reported using band returns of Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica) in the Eastern Hemisphere (rm = 0.03).

abstract={Little is known about juvenile birds' movements during the post-fledging stage of development, especially in urbanizing landscapes where novel ecological factors such as invasive plants and altered densities of conspecifics might influence fledglings' use of space. In 2008 and 2009 we used radio telemetry to track movements of fledgling Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis; n = 45) and Acadian Flycatchers (Empidonax virescens; n = 31) in a network of riparian forests embedded within a rural-to-urban gradient of landscapes in central Ohio. A subset of 20 cardinals and 11 flycatchers survived sufficiently long for subsequent analyses of their movement. Natal ranges of juvenile cardinals decreased in size with proximity to fragment edge, and fledglings moved less from nests surrounded by extensive cover of the Amur honeysuckle (Lonicera maackii). Conversely, the size of natal ranges of juvenile flycatchers was positively related to honeysuckle cover. During the study period, 70% of the cardinals dispersed from natal sites at an average of 47 ± 2 days after fledging. Dispersal patterns of individual cardinals varied; birds dispersed locally within their natal forest fragment or made extended movements into the surrounding landscape matrix. In our study area the density of cardinals increased with urbanization, and fledglings tended to disperse later from sites of high densities of conspecifics. Collectively, our results suggest that while novel ecological factors associated with urbanization may influence fledglings' movements, patterns are likely species-specific. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2013.},

abstract={Salmo salar (Atlantic Salmon) smolts are exposed to predation pressure as they migrate from freshwater into the estuary and near-shore marine environment. In particular, Phalacrocorax auritus (Double-crested Cormorants) are a predator of Atlantic salmon smolts during their estuary and near-shore migration. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Services' (NMFS) telemetry data collected prior to this study (1997-2003), suggest that smolts are being removed from the Narraguagus River on their downstream out-migration. This removal may be the result of Cormorant predation. We investigated whether smolt survival could be improved by disrupting normal Cormorant foraging activity by integrating passive smolt tracking and active harassment techniques. Smolt movement and usage of various portions of the estuary according to light condition and tidal stage were explored along with concurrent avian harassment. Although harassment only occurred in approximately 33% of available daylight hours during this study, the impacts were easily recognized. Non-lethal harassment effectively displaced Cormorants from feeding locations and reduced loss of emigrating smolts. In 2004, 83.3% (15 of 18) of all smolt mortalities occurred on days of non-harassment, compared to only 16.7% (3 of 18) on days when harassment occurred. Similarly in 2005, 87.5% (7 of 8) of all smolt mortalities occurred on days of non-harassment, compared to only 12.5% (1 of 8) on days when harassment occurred. Non-lethal harassment appeared to be an effective means to reduce loss of emigrating smolts in the Narraguagus River estuary.},

abstract={Behavioral plasticity is a strategy employed by many species to cope with both naturally occurring and human-mediated environmental variability. Such plasticity may be especially important for long-lived and wide-ranging species, such as parrots, that likely face great temporal and spatial variation within their long lifespans, and are often disproportionately affected by anthropogenic habitat change. We used radio-telemetry and roost counts to assess ranging patterns, habitat usage, and roosting behaviors of the Yellow-naped Amazon (Amazona auropalliata) at two sites in northern Costa Rica with different degrees of anthropogenic habitat alteration. We compared behaviors for residents at the two sites and for experimentally translocated individuals to test the hypothesis that this species would employ behavioral plasticity in response to habitat differences. We found that individuals in the region with dispersed vegetation recorded ranging movements and communal roosting behavior ten times larger than the region with concentrated vegetation. Translocated individuals showed flexibility in these behaviors and matched the behavioral patterns of resident birds at the release site rather than maintaining behaviors characteristic of their capture site. Our results illustrate a generalized rapid plastic response to human-induced changes in habitat for a number of behavioral traits in the Yellow-naped Amazon. Such plasticity is directly relevant to reintroduction efforts that are commonly employed as a conservation tool in parrots. Our study provides an example of how behavioral plasticity may allow some wild populations to withstand anthropogenic change. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Survival of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) has been well described in large populations across the species range. Very little published information exists, however, on survival rates of translocated sage-grouse or grouse from a long-term (&gt;10 yr) study. Our objectives were to estimate seasonal and annual survival rates; assess differences in survival between resident and translocated, adult and yearling, and male and female sage-grouse; identify environmental and behavioral factors associated with survival; and assess the influence of mammalian predator control on survival rates of radio-marked sage-grouse in Strawberry Valley, Utah from 1998 to 2010. We used a 2-stage model selection approach using Akaike's Information Criterion corrected for sample size (AICc) with known-fate models in Program MARK to evaluate the influences of seasonal, annual, demographic, and behavioral effects on survival rates of sage-grouse. We captured and fitted 535 individual sage-grouse (male and female, resident and translocated) with radio transmitters over a 13-year period and monitored them weekly. The top model of survival, which accounted for 22% of the AICc weight, included 3 seasons that varied by year where rates were influenced by residency, sex, and whether a female initiated a nest. A group-level covariate for the number of canids killed each year received some support as this variable improved model fit compared to identical models without it, although confidence intervals around β estimates overlapped zero slightly. All other demographic or environmental variables showed little or no support. Annual estimates of survival for females ranged between 28% and 84% depending on year and translocation source. Survival was consistently highest during the fall-winter months with a mean monthly survival rate of 0.97 (95% CI = 0.96-0.98). The lack of a control site and other potential confounding factors limit the extent of our inference with respect to predator control. Nonetheless, we suggest managers consider enhancing nesting habitat, translocating sage-grouse, and possibly controlling predators to improve survival rates of sage-grouse. © The Wildlife Society, 2013 Copyright © The Wildlife Society, 2013.},

abstract={The identification of core habitat areas and resulting prediction maps are vital tools for land managers. Often, agencies have large datasets from multiple studies over time that could be combined for a more informed and complete picture of a species. Colorado Parks and Wildlife has a large database for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) including 11 radio-telemetry studies completed over 12 years (1997-2008) across northwestern Colorado. We divided the 49,470-km2 study area into 1-km2 grids with the number of sage-grouse locations in each grid cell that contained at least 1 location counted as the response variable. We used a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) using land cover variables as fixed effects and individual birds and populations as random effects to predict greater sage-grouse location counts during breeding, summer, and winter seasons. The mixed effects model enabled us to model correlations that may exist in grouped data (e.g., correlations among individuals and populations). We found only individual groupings accounted for variation in the summer and breeding seasons, but not the winter season. The breeding and summer seasonal models predicted sage-grouse presence in the currently delineated populations for Colorado, but we found little evidence supporting a winter season model. According to our models, about 50% of the study area in Colorado is considered highly or moderately suitable habitat in both the breeding and summer seasons. As oil and gas development and other landscape changes occur in this portion of Colorado, knowledge of where management actions can be accomplished or possible restoration can occur becomes more critical. These seasonal models provide data-driven, distribution maps that managers and biologists can use for identification and exploration when investigating greater sage-grouse issues across the Colorado range. Using historic data for future decisions on species management while accounting for issues found from combining datasets allows land managers the flexibility to use all information available. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={The southeast Beaufort Sea is a critical spring staging area for common and king eiders (Somateria mollissima v-nigrum, S. spectabilis), and is for many the final stop before they reach their breeding grounds throughout the western Canadian Arctic. The region also has significant oil and gas potential, and the recent approval of a pipeline through the Mackenzie Valley may make development of these resources economically viable. We used satellite telemetry to determine the distribution and habitat use of eiders staging in the southeast Beaufort Sea in spring, and the overlap of eiders with oil and gas exploration. From 2004 to 2009, we monitored 51 eiders equipped with platform terminal transmitters (PTTs) throughout spring migration (May-June). We compared the marine habitats used by each species, and evaluated habitat preferences using resource selection functions. The location and extent of the flaw lead (open water along the interface between mobile pack ice and stationary landfast ice) at the time when eiders were staging varied among years, but both species showed a strong preference for use of flaw lead habitats. This preference was stronger for common eiders than for king eiders, which also used pack ice extensively. Common eiders generally occurred near the landfast ice edge, whereas king eiders were just as often nearer to the pack ice edge of the flaw lead. Average water depth (±SE) for common eiders was 22 ± 2 m compared to 30 ± 1 m for king eiders. Kernel density estimators showed that eiders generally occurred in lower densities in areas of otherwise suitable habitat off the Mackenzie River delta. We suggest that this is a result of the highly turbid water discharged by the Mackenzie River, which limits visibility. Oil and gas exploration overlapped significantly with the areas used by eiders. The high density of birds using the restricted and ice-rich flaw lead habitats indicates that an accidental spill in the region could be catastrophic for Canada's western Arctic eider populations. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={We captured and radio-marked 64 Dryocopus pileatus (Pileated Woodpecker) in bottomland hardwood forests from February 2007 to June 2010. At least 12 (35.3%) of the first 34 birds radio-tagged died within 43 d of capture ( = 8.2 d). Thus, we adjusted our radio-attachment techniques adaptively from a figure-eight harness to a tail-mount, and reduced handling times to minimize stress on woodpeckers. In 2009 and 2010, after the change in attachment type and modified handling protocol including a reduction of handling time (from ca. 1 h to 30 min), all 30 radio-marked birds (100%) survived the entire field season (≥3 mo). These data suggested that Pileated Woodpeckers, and perhaps other large woodpeckers, have an increased risk of death when tagged with figure eight harnesses, handled for longer periods and more obtrusively, and captured on days with relatively cold temperatures. We submit that future telemetry on this species or other large woodpeckers should not employ the figure-eight harnesses and should strive to minimize handling time and disturbance. We recommend that other ornithologists observing higher than expected mortalities possibly related to handling birds or transmitter attachment publish this information to minimize the adverse impacts on birds during future research.},

abstract={The multifaceted courtship display of male satin bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, involves several elements that have been studied in detail. However, one of their most unique display elements, bower painting, has received relatively little attention despite males' large investment of time in this behaviour. Male bowerbirds chew plant material and apply the resulting mixture of masticated vegetation and male saliva or 'bower paint' to a chest-high band inside their bower walls. Searching females taste this paint, suggesting that paint may be a chemosensory signal. We used both behavioural observations and experimental approaches to examine predictions made by two hypotheses for the function of bower paint. We measured natural variation in paint quantity to investigate whether quantity of paint at bowers is related to other male display traits, male mating success and male physical condition. We also investigated whether males and females are affected by experimental removal of bower paint. Additionally, we assessed male response to paint transplants from other individuals. We found a significant correlation between the amount of paint and a composite estimate of several other measures known to indicate bower and decoration display quality. Also, males whose bowers underwent experimental removal of paint had fewer females return for second courtships and copulations than did control males. This result provides the first experimental evidence that females respond to bower paint. These findings establish that bower paint is a trait that affects mate-searching decisions by females and demonstrates that the quantity of bower paint is important in attracting females. © 2013 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.},

abstract={Aim: Elevational Rapoport's rule, proposed in 1992 by Stevens, predicts that species ranges on mountains become larger in elevational extent with increasing elevation. Here we test this prediction using 160 datasets of range size measured by maximum elevational extents for bats, birds, frogs, non-volant small mammals, reptiles, and salamanders from mountains around the globe. Location: Mountains distributed globally and spanning 36.5°S to 48.2°N. Methods: We compare three methods: (1) the Stevens method, which uses the average range size of all species within each elevational band (100-m bands); (2) the midpoint method, which uses the average range size of species whose midpoints occur in each elevational band; and (3) a quartile method that examines the distribution of only the smallest ranges (less than one-quarter of the mountain height) to see if their frequency distribution is negatively related to elevation. Results: Support for the elevational Rapoport's rule was weak across all groups of montane vertebrates. For the Stevens method, the mean r2 value was 0.32, and strong support (positive relationship, r2 value&gt;0.50) was detected in 40% of the studies, ranging from 20% for salamanders to 57% for frogs. For the midpoint method, the mean r2 value was 0.06, and none of the datasets showed strong support. For the quartile method, the mean r2 value was 0.26, and strong support (negative relationship, r2 value&gt;0.40) was detected in 38% of the studies, ranging between 10.5% in salamanders and 58% in reptiles. Main conclusions: Across vertebrates, and within the literature for plants and invertebrates, more empirical studies find a lack of trend than the predicted trend of increasing range size with increasing elevation. Thus, elevational Rapoport's rule is not a consistently predictive pattern for understanding montane patterns in range size. © 2012 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Foraging theory suggests animals should prefer habitats with a greater density of prey, but few have investigated whether birds change foraging habitats according to short-term changes in prey abundance caused by weather. We studied a woodpecker, the northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), in which the diet is composed mainly of ants collected on the ground surface. We measured the surface density of the ant prey in 1-m2 quadrats placed in 2 habitat types that had different thermal properties: open grassland and forest. The density of ants varied according to year of the study, habitat type, date during the summer, and time of day and was strongly associated with ambient temperature. In the shaded forest habitat, ant density increased linearly with air temperatures between 6 and 28 °C In contrast, the surface activity of ants in the open habitat exposed to sun began to decline once ground surface temperatures reached 26 °C Ant densities were higher in the open habitat than in the shade in relatively cold conditions but were higher in the shaded forest habitat when it was hot. Using radio telemetry, we recorded the habitat use of foraging flickers and found they shifted from foraging in the open when it was cold to foraging in shaded habitats when it was hot. Flickers tracked the density of their main prey on fine spatial and short temporal scales consistent with foraging theory.},

We estimated BBMM home ranges for 11 Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus) and 7 Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura) equipped with satellite transmitters near Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort, South Carolina, from October 2006 to November 2008. The 95% BBMM home ranges (95% BBMM) of the two Black Vultures that traveled &gt;100 km from the capture site were 833 and 2111 km2; of the nine that did not travel as far, 95% BBMM ranged from 33 to 778 km2 and averaged (± SE) 243 ± 76 km2. The majority of Turkey Vultures (n = 6) traveled &gt;100 km from the capture site with 95% BBMM ranging from 923 to 7058 km2 and averaging 3173 ± 1109 km 2. We also estimated KDE home ranges, using newer satellite technology for comparison with previous studies. Overall 95% KDE ranged from 17 to 16066 km2 for the Black Vulture and 988 to 36257 km2 for the Turkey Vulture. The concept of an animal's home range has evolved over time, as have home-range estimators. With increasing use of satellite telemetry, application of BBMM can greatly enhance our understanding of home ranges, migration routes, seasonal movements, and habitat-use patterns of wild birds over large and often remote areas. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2013.},

abstract={Reliable estimates of annual harvest rates are required for the implementation of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) adaptive harvest management decision frameworks. Because not all standard bands recovered during the hunting season are reported, band reporting probabilities are needed to estimate mallard harvest rates. Information from birds recovered with bands that notify finders of a reward (i.e., reward bands) can be used to estimate band reporting rates. We analyzed reward banding data for 3 stocks of mallards to estimate reporting probabilities that can be used to estimate harvest rates for birds recovered with toll-free or web-address bands. Specifically, we explored spatial variability in reporting probabilities, and assessed whether reporting probabilities varied among years. Our analysis indicated that reporting probabilities varied among the 4 Flyways, eastern Canada, and western Canada and Alaska. We had difficulty interpreting temporal fluctuations and found little evidence for any meaningful trends in reporting rates between 2002 and 2010. We recommend that reporting probabilities of 0.67 in the Atlantic Flyway, 0.81 in the Mississippi Flyway, 0.70 in the Central Flyway, 0.76 in the Pacific Flyway, 0.50 in eastern Canada, and 0.57 in western Canada and Alaska be used to estimate harvest probabilities for birds recovered in these regions. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Aim: Assessing the influence of land cover in species distribution modelling is limited by the availability of fine-resolution land-cover data appropriate for most species responses. Remote-sensing technology offers great potential for predicting species distributions at large scales, but the cost and required expertise are prohibitive for many applications. We test the usefulness of freely available raw remote-sensing reflectance data in predicting species distributions of 40 commonly occurring bird species in western Oregon. Location: Central Coast Range, Cascade and Klamath Mountains Oregon, USA. Methods: Information on bird observations was collected from 4598 fixed-radius point counts. Reflectance data were obtained using 30-m resolution Landsat imagery summarized at scales of 150, 500, 1000 and 2000 m. We used boosted regression tree (BRT) models to analyse relationships between distributions of birds and reflectance values and evaluated prediction performance of the models using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. Results: Prediction success of models using all reflectance values was high (mean AUC = 0.79 ± 0.10 SD). Further, model performance using individual reflectance bands exceeded those that used only Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The relative influence of band 4 predictors was highest, indicating the importance of variables associated with vegetation biomass and photosynthetic activity. Across spatial scales, the average influence of predictors at the 2000 m scale was greatest. Main Conclusions: We demonstrate that unclassified remote-sensing imagery can be used to produce species distribution models with high prediction success. Our study is the first to identify general patterns in the usefulness of spectral reflectances for species distribution modelling of multiple species. We conclude that raw Landsat Thematic Mapper data will be particularly useful in species distribution models when high-resolution predictions are required, including habitat change detection studies, identification of fine-scale biodiversity hotspots and reserve design. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={North-central Minnesota has a system of waterfowl refuges that were created over the last 6 decades to benefit ring-necked ducks (Aythya collaris). New refuges were placed to complement existing refuges and to relieve high hunting pressure in bog areas that were traditionally remote and inaccessible but were receiving increasing use. These refuges have been credited with keeping waterfowl in the area, but this has not been substantiated with data. Furthermore, the survival benefits of these refuges, if any, to locally produced ring-necked ducks have not been evaluated. We examined weekly mortality and movements onto and off of refuges with data from young ring-necked ducks captured and radio-marked before fledging. We used a multi-state model to investigate factors affecting transitions between 4 states (i.e., alive and on a refuge, alive and off a refuge, dead and off a refuge, and dead and on a refuge), and to account for variation in detection probabilities. Our most-supported model based on Akaike's Information Criterion with a small sample size correction (AICc) included movements onto and off of refuge as a function of year and hunting season, and mortality as a function of year, hunting season, and sex. The second ranked model (ΔAICc = 2.74) was similar to the top model but without the sex effect. Other models received considerably less support. Mortality was greater during hunting season than before hunting opened. Young males had greater mortality rates (mean ± SE) off the refuge than young females both before (0.050 ± 0.004 vs. 0.030 ± 0.002) and during hunting season (0.234 ± 0.019 vs. 0.137 ± 0.011). Probabilities of movement onto refuges were greater during hunting seasons than during weeks with no hunting pressure (0.073 ± 0.046 vs. 0.023 ± 0.015), although birds left refuges at a similar rate during hunting and before hunting seasons (0.424 ± 0.116 vs. 0.457 ± 0.125). Birds that used refuges were detected on the study area longer. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that ducks benefit from refuges; we found lesser mortality of birds on refuges (no birds were detected dead on a refuge), and greater mortality off refuges during hunting season. We did not evaluate whether survival benefits of refuges accrued from reduced disturbance, greater time foraging, benefits of membership in a flock, or simply safety from hunters. Future studies examining food availability and foraging behavior on and off refuges may help clarify the contributions of these variables to reducing mortality of young ring-necked ducks during hunting seasons. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Researchers often attach radio transmitters and other devices to free-living birds without a clear understanding of the possible consequences for their study organisms or their data. Although transmitters may affect parental investment (nest defense and offspring provisioning), this possibility has received little attention. We tested this hypothesis by placing mock radio transmitters on male Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and comparing their behavior to that of uncaptured birds and procedural controls. Birds with transmitters defended their nests less vigorously than did uncaptured birds but did not modify their provisioning effort. This behavioral modification appears to have ultimately influenced predation rates, as nests of birds with transmitters had lower daily survival rates and were less likely to fledge offspring. Control birds that were captured, handled, and bled had intermediate levels of nest defense and productivity that were statistically indistinguishable from those of birds receiving other treatments, suggesting that capture, restraint, and blood collection may affect birds in ways that are independent of transmitters' effects. Interestingly, we also found limited evidence that females mated to males with transmitters increased their provisioning effort, possibly in compensation for a perceived reduction in their mate's care. Because attachment of a transmitter (and potentially blood sampling) directly affected the behavior and reproduction of birds with transmitters and may have indirectly affected the behavior of their mates, we suggest researchers cautiously balance the benefits of such methods against potential data biases and impairment of reproduction. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2013.},

abstract={The aim of the present study was to investigate the feeding ecology of an omnivorous bird, the Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis Ord, 1815), breeding in a highly urbanized and heterogeneous landscape (Montréal area, Quebec, Canada). We used gastrointestinal (G.I.) tract content analysis, GPS-based tracking information, and stable isotope profiles of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) in selected tissues and major food items. Based on GPS tracking data (1-3 days), Ring-billed Gulls were categorized according to their use of three main foraging habitats: agricultural, St. Lawrence River, and anthropogenic (comprising urban areas, landfills, and wastewater treatment plant basins). Ring-billed Gulls that foraged predominantly in anthropogenic habitats exhibited significantly lower δ15N in blood cells and higher total C to N ratios (C:N) in liver. These lower δ15N and higher C:N ratios were characteristic of profiles determined in food items consumed by Ring-billed Gulls at these urbanized sites (e.g., processed foods). The strong positive correlations between δ13C and δ15N in Ring-billed Gull tissues (plasma, blood cells, and liver) that differed in isotopic turnover times, as well as the strong positive correlations in both δ13C and δ15N between tissue pairs, indicated that Ring-billed Gulls exhibited conserved dietary habits throughout the nesting period. This study demonstrates that combining conventional dietary examination, tissue stable isotope analysis, and fine-scale GPS tracking information may improve our understanding of the large intrapopulation variations in foraging behaviour (and isotopic profiles) commonly observed in omnivorous birds.},

abstract={In long-lived animals, survival rate is a key demographic parameter affecting population dynamics. The objective of this study was to estimate the apparent survival rate of adult Long-tailed Jaegers (Stercorarius longicaudus) breeding at one of the most northerly sites on earth, northern Ellesmere Island, Canada. Because of the large temporal fluctuations in numbers of lemmings, their primary food source during the summer, we also investigated the effect of annual variations in lemming abundance on survival rate. Analysis was based on 336 individuals marked as adults over 11 years with metal and color bands and capture-mark-recapture techniques. There was strong support for a model with two age classes, as survival of newly marked birds was 18% lower than that of previously marked ones. This difference could be due to a true age effect (if a high proportion of young adults was present in our initial samples) or, perhaps more likely, to the presence of transient individuals in the population. The estimated probability of apparent annual survival of local birds (corrected for color-band loss) was 0.91, comparable to values for other seabirds, and was constant over time. We detected a weak trend for a decrease in apparent survival rate of newly marked birds in years of high lemming abundance but no effect on the survival of previously marked birds. This suggests that conditions at sea during the nonbreeding season may be more important in affecting annual survival. A new longevity record of 22 years was established for the species. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2013.},

abstract={We evaluated spatial and temporal differences in migratory behavior among different breeding groups of midcontinent greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons) using band-recovery data and observations of neck collared geese during migration and winter. Birds from different breeding areas were initially delineated by geographic distance into 6 banding reference areas (BRAs): 1) interior Alaska, 2) North Slope of Alaska, 3) western Northwest Territories (NWT), 4) western Nunavut, 5) central Nunavut, and 6) eastern Nunavut. The banding groups also differed by breeding habitat, with geese from interior Alaska nesting in the boreal forest (taiga), and all other groups breeding in tundra habitats. Geese from interior Alaska migrated earlier during autumn, and were more likely to winter farther south (in Mexico) than geese from other breeding areas. Geese banded in central and eastern Nunavut (Queen Maud Gulf and Inglis River) wintered farther east (in Louisiana) than geese from other breeding areas. Small-scale (within-state) geographic segregation of wintering flocks was evidenced by the recent (post-1990) nearly exclusive use of a new wintering area in north central Texas by geese from interior Alaska. Segregation among BRAs was also apparent in Mexico, where taiga geese were found predominantly in the central Highlands (states of Zacatecas and Durango), whereas tundra geese mostly used states along the Gulf Coast (primarily Tamaulipas). Interior Alaska birds initiated spring migration earlier than geese from other areas, and were more likely than others to stop in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, a region where cholera outbreaks periodically kill thousands of geese. Geese from interior Alaska were the first to arrive at spring staging areas in prairie Canada where BRAs exhibited spatial delineation (a longitudinal cline) in relation to breeding areas. Our results show significant geographic and temporal variation among taiga and tundra breeding cohorts during autumn, winter, and spring. Temporal and spatial differences in migratory behavior may allow management practices that accommodate potential demographic differences between taiga and tundra populations. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Knowledge of dispersal patterns and survival rates is essential to understand population dynamics and demography, and to develop effective long-term management strategies for species of conservation concern. In New England, Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) were extirpated as a breeding species in the 1960s. Following a captive breeding and release program, the population subsequently underwent a rapid, dispersal-based expansion into its former range, particularly during the last two decades. Use of buildings, bridges, and other human-made structures for nesting has become widespread in urban areas, where the species only infrequently nested prior to reintroduction. We analyzed encounters of Peregrine Falcons banded as nestlings in the six New England states between May 1990 and June 2009 to determine: (a) differences in dispersal patterns (distance and direction) by sex; (b) differences in movement and natal dispersal among birds from cliff and artificial nest sites; (c) causes of mortality; and (d) effects of sex, age, and natal habitat type on survivorship. Of 986 Peregrine Falcons banded, 24% were encountered again at least once by December 2009. Although most encounters (76%) occurred within the study area, 24% were outside New England in eight other eastern states, three Canadian provinces, Cuba, and Nicaragua. Five percent of the marked population was later confirmed at breeding territories in the eastern U.S.A., primarily in New England. Females dispersed greater distances (natal dispersal = 152.6 km; range = 70.2-853.5 km; n = 28) than males (88.0 km; range = 0.03-1009.7 km; n = 22). New England peregrines showed a strong tendency to settle at nest types similar to those on which they were raised (rural cliff vs. urban structures); however, we documented movement from urban to rural habitats and vice versa in equal proportions. The causes of mortality for 122 recovered birds included unknown (61%), collisions with aircraft (11%), collisions with stationary objects (8%), falling from nest site (8%), collisions with vehicles or trains (7%), gunshot wounds (2%), entanglement in fishing gear (1%), and poisoning (1%). Most deaths occurred among first-year (68%) and second-year (11%) birds, with first-year peregrines experiencing significantly higher mortality than other age classes. The estimated annual survival rate for second-year and adult falcons combined was 81%, whereas our estimate for first-year birds was only 9%; however, the latter rate likely is a significant underestimate. We found no effect of natal habitat or sex on survival. © 2013 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={The effects of edge habitat on wildlife populations have been studied extensively in recent decades, but most studies have focused on describing patterns of edge effects rather than identifying the mechanisms driving these effects. Based on evidence of lower densities of shrubland birds in edge versus interior habitat, we tested four hypotheses that could produce a pattern of apparent edge avoidance: ( 1) active avoidance of edges due to high risk of predation in edge habitat, ( 2) conspecific interactions that promote greater use of interior habitat due to territorial defense, ( 3) passive displacement of avian home ranges, such that sampling in the interior is more likely to intersect multiple home ranges compared to sampling at edges, and ( 4) home range expansion along edges. To test these hypotheses, we radio-marked 39 male Yellow-breasted Chats ( Icteria virens) during the breeding seasons of 2005 and 2006 and relocated each bird 4. -. 5. days/week. Our results did not support the hypothesis that Yellow-breasted Chats avoided habitat edges in either home range placement or habitat usage within their home ranges though there was some support for greater usage of interior habitat during the peak of the breeding season. Size of home ranges did not vary with distance from edge. These results support the passive displacement hypothesis and, to a lesser extent, the conspecific interactions hypothesis. The passive displacement hypothesis predicts lower abundances in the edges compared to the center of a habitat patch because areas in the patch center receive individuals from all directions whereas areas near the edges do not. Thus, edge habitat may still provide quality habitat for shrubland birds in our system. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Spring migrations for nine birds were documented, and 78% (n = 7) showed fidelity to breeding range. Two complete migrations for two individuals were documented, and they demonstrated fidelity to winter range. The longest, fastest movement documented was 2,300 km in less than 74 hr. Extensive, post-breeding dispersal was not observed in the adult male American Bitterns in this study. Six male American Bitterns were marked with PTTs on winter range in Florida and Texas. Spring migration for these birds was documented to Nebraska, North Dakota, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario. Sixty-seven American Bitterns were marked with Very High Frequency radio transmitters on summer ranges, and 16% (n = 11) were located on wintering grounds used by the satellite-tracked birds, further documenting the importance of the Everglades and the Louisiana coast as winter habitat for American Bitterns that breed in Central North America.},

abstract={Lower order, non-fish-bearing streams, often termed "headwater streams", have received minimal research effort and protection priority, especially in mesic forests where distinction between riparian and upland vegetation can be subtle. Though it is generally thought that breeding bird abundance is higher in riparian zones, little is known about species distributions when birds are in their juvenile stage - a critical period in terms of population viability. Using radio telemetry, we examined factors affecting habitat selection by juvenile Swainson's thrushes during the post-breeding period in headwater basins in the Coast Range of Oregon, USA. We tested models containing variables expected to influence the amount of food and cover (i.e., deciduous cover, coarse wood volume, and proximity to stream) as well as models containing variables that are frequently measured and manipulated in forest management (i.e., deciduous and coniferous trees separated into size classes). Juvenile Swainson's thrushes were more likely to select locations with at least 25% cover of deciduous, mid-story vegetation and more than 2.0m3/ha of coarse wood within 40m of headwater streams. We conclude that despite their small and intermittent nature, headwater streams and adjacent riparian areas are selected over upland areas by Swainson's thrush during the postfledging period in the Oregon Coast Range. © 2013.},

abstract={Animal movements and habitat selection within the home range, or microhabitat selection, can provide insights into habitat requirements, such as foraging and area requirements. The King Rail (Rallus elegans) is a wetland bird of high conservation concern in the United States, but little is known about its movements, habitats, or demography. King Rails (n = 34) were captured during the 2010-2011 breeding seasons in the coastal marshes of southwest Louisiana and southeast Texas. Radio telemetry and direct habitat surveys of King Rail locations were conducted to estimate home ranges and microhabitat selection. Within home ranges, King Rails selected for greater plant species richness and comparatively greater coverage of Phragmites australis, Typha spp., and Schoenoplectus robustus. King Rails were found closer to open water compared to random locations placed 50 m from King Rail locations. Home ranges (n = 22) varied from 0.8-32.8 ha and differed greatly among sites. Home range size did not vary by year or sex; however, increased open water, with a maximum of 29% observed in the study, was correlated with smaller home ranges. Breeding season cumulative survivorship was 89% ± 22% in 2010 and 61% ± 43% in 2011, which coincided with a drought. With an equal search effort, King Rail chicks and juveniles observed in May-June decreased from 110 in 2010 to only 16 in the drier year of 2011. The findings show King Rail used marsh with ≤ 29% open water and had smaller home ranges when open water was more abundant.},

abstract={Monitoring of birds often requires the use of very-high-frequency radios or satellite telemetry to enhance detectability of individuals. An assumption implicit in such studies is that radio-marked individuals are representative of the population at whole, which requires that radios do not influence an individual's behavior or demographics. We present results from a capture-mark-recapture study of male Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), some radio collared, others only banded, in an experimental framework to assess whether radio collars influenced the birds' behavior or survival. We generated encounter histories of 906 male Greater Sage-Grouse and used a robust-design framework in program Mark to estimate probabilities of annual survival, detection, and temporary emigration from the lek for the radio-collared and banded segments of the sample population. Results of models suggested that seasonal detection rates at leks the year after capture were 3-5 times higher for males only banded than for males equipped with radio collars. These results also suggested a possible negative influence of radio collars on males' annual survival and annual lek attendance. We suggest researchers should exercise caution when designing studies or analyzing data that rely on radio-collared male Greater Sage-Grouse. ©The Cooper Ornithological Society 2013.},

During 4 test sessions on 7, 8, 10, and 11 June 2010, we recorded 60 experimentally controlled logging trucks; 30 non-experimental, civilian, fixed-winged aircraft; 3 non-experimental, passing cars; and 1 all-terrain vehicle (ATV). Logging truck sound, principally engine and exhaust, was concentrated in the 63 Hz and 80 Hz, 1/3-octave frequency bands. Aircraft sound was concentrated in the 100 Hz and 125 Hz, 1/3-octave frequency bands. Logging truck noise levels varied among nest sites and with distance from roads. At 167 m from the closest road, the logging truck averaged approximately 8 decibels (dB, all decibel levels C-weighted, adjusted, 1 s, equivalent sound level, CLEQ) quieter than aircraft. At 143 m, the logging truck was approximately 3 dB quieter than passing aircraft. Only at 78 m was logging truck noise louder on average than aircraft, by approximately 6 dB. Average aircraft noise levels for each day of testing ranged between 45.6 dB and 67.9 dB and when averaged across the entire study period, varied little among the 3 test sites, 60.1-65.6 dB. On average, our test logging truck (61.9 dB) was no louder than passing aircraft (62.3 dB), which goshawks generally ignored. The logging truck resulted in 27% no response and 73% alert (head turning) response, passing aircraft resulted in 90% no response and only 10% alert response, and the cars and ATV combined resulted in 50% each for no response and alert response. Goshawk alert response rates were inversely proportional to nest distance from the nearest road, decreasing from 91% to 57% alert between 78 m and 167 m. No movements or flushes were associated with either our experimental testing or passive recording of other vehicular noise stimuli. All tested pairs of goshawks successfully fledged young. Because logging truck noise had no effect on northern goshawks nesting along level 3, improved gravel roads on the Kaibab Plateau, restriction of log hauling and other road-based travel activities on similar roads within post-fledging family areas (PFAs) appears unnecessary based on the type and extent of our testing. © The Wildlife Society, 2013.},

abstract={Interest in monitoring the population viability of the Brown Pelican (Pelecanus occidentalis) has recently risen in the context of the species' 2009 delisting as endangered, rapid degradation of nesting habitat, and recent oil spills. To assess the Brown Pelican's patterns of movement (across natal colony, nonnatal colony, and noncolony islands), age and sex structure, and survival probabilities, we banded 1177 chicks in Louisiana from 2007 to 2009. In band-resighting surveys within the Isles Dernieres archipelago from 2008 to 2010, we detected 92 of our banded birds. Neither age nor sex appeared to influence where we observed pelicans resting on beaches across the islands, and we found the highest proportions of pelicans at their natal island. Yet few observations of banded birds suggest either movement outside our study area or mortality. Conditions at colonies and proximity to other sites of loafing or colonies may in part explain the disparity in proportions of resightings of individuals banded on different islands. Finally, the apparent probability of survival of one-year-old pelicans was lower than that of two- and three-year olds. Insights into these trends in movement and survival of young Brown Pelicans can improve future management of colony sites. © 2013 by The Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={In capture-recapture studies, the estimation accuracy of demographic parameters is essential to the efficacy of management of hunted animal populations. Dead recovery models based upon the reporting of rings or bands are often used for estimating survival of waterfowl and other harvested species. However, distance from the ringing site or condition of the bird may introduce substantial individual heterogeneity in the conditional band reporting rates (r), which could cause bias in estimated survival rates (S) or suggest nonexistent individual heterogeneity in S. To explore these hypotheses, we ran two sets of simulations (n = 1000) in MARK using Seber's dead recovery model, allowing time variation on both S and r. This included a series of heterogeneity models, allowing substantial variation on logit(r), and control models with no heterogeneity. We conducted simulations using two different values of S: S = 0.60, which would be typical of dabbling ducks such as mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), and S = 0.80, which would be more typical of sea ducks or geese. We chose a mean reporting rate on the logit scale of -1.9459 with SD = 1.5 for the heterogeneity models (producing a back-transformed mean of 0.196 with SD = 0.196, median = 0.125) and a constant reporting rate for the control models of 0.196. Within these sets of simulations, estimation models where σS = 0 and σS > 0 (σS is SD of individual survival rates on the logit scale) were incorporated to investigate whether real heterogeneity in r would induce apparent individual heterogeneity in S. Models where σS = 0 were selected approximately 91% of the time over models where σS > 0. Simulation results showed < 0.05% relative bias in estimating survival rates except for models estimating σS > 0 when true S = 0.8, where relative bias was a modest 0.5%. These results indicate that considerable variation in reporting rates does not cause major bias in estimated survival rates of waterfowl, further highlighting the robust nature of dead recovery models that are being used for the management of harvested species. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={Dispersal decisions of songbirds are relatively well understood between breeding seasons, but far less is known about dispersal between nesting attempts and during the molting period. There are several non-mutually exclusive hypotheses for why birds disperse during breeding and molt including: (1) avoiding predation, (2) because of depleted resources, or (3) seeking higher quality habitat. In this study, we evaluated the above hypotheses by radio-tracking a Neotropical migrant, the Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), during breeding and molt. During breeding, 30% (7/23) of females moved territories within-season. Females were not more likely to move off-territory following nest predation, and dispersing females were not in poorer nutritional state than non-dispersing females prior to the move. However, females occupying nest sites with large trees, high canopy height and percent canopy cover, and low percent ground cover were more likely to move off-territory for their second nest to sites with few large trees, a low canopy height and cover, and high percent ground cover. During the molting period, 61% (28/46) of birds moved off-territory to molt. Molting areas were associated with more shrubs and fruiting trees compared with breeding territories. There were no sex or age effects as to whether a bird molted on or off their breeding territory. We suggest that off-territory movements during the nesting period are to seek more suitable nesting vegetation, rather than specifically avoiding predation or because of reduced resource availability. This study has additionally shown that, without radio-telemetry, detecting off-territory movements during breeding is difficult and neglecting to include these movements may result in an underestimation of annual productivity. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Grassland birds are declining at an alarming rate and habitat limitation on the wintering grounds may play a major role in population declines. In an attempt to understand habitat needs and constraints of grassland bird species on their wintering grounds, we conducted the first-ever telemetry study to document the movements of a wintering grassland passerine bird in grasslands of the Chihuahuan Desert in northern Mexico. We attached radio-transmitters to 99 Vesper Sparrows in January of 2009 and 2010 and tracked them for up to 51 days. We estimated vegetation characteristics at foraging, roosting and random locations. We used kernel density estimators of the utilization distribution for each individual sparrow to estimate home range size. We found differences in average home range size between 2009 and 2010 (108.46 ± 36.43 ha and 30.91 ± 4.74 ha, respectively). Home ranges showed high levels of intraspecific overlap, with average pairwise overlap of 0.41, 0.70 and 0.79 among individuals at three study sites, as measured by the Bhattacharyya's affinity. Grasses and shrubs were shorter in foraging locations than in random sites within Vesper Sparrow core habitat, but we found no differences in grass cover and shrub cover. We suggest that movements of Vesper Sparrows are mostly limited to &lt;1 km2 during the winter and hypothesize that these movements are subject to constraints by food limitation and predation. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={In theory, habitat preferences should be adaptive. Accordingly, fitness is often assumed to be greater in preferred habitats; however, this assumption is rarely tested and, when it is, the results are often equivocal. Habitat preferences may not directly convey fitness advantages if animals are constrained by tradeoffs with other selective pressures like predation or food availability. We address unresolved questions about the survival consequences of habitat choices made during brood-rearing in a precocial species with exclusive maternal care (mallard Anas platyrhynchos, n = 582 radio-marked females on 27 sites over 8 years). We directly linked duckling survival with habitat selection patterns at two spatial scales using logistic regression and model selection techniques. At the landscape scale (55-80 km2), females that demonstrated stronger selection of areas with more cover type 4 wetlands and greater total cover type 3 wetland area (wetlands with large expanses of open water surrounded by either a narrow or wide peripheral band of vegetation, respectively) had lower duckling survival rates than did females that demonstrated weaker selection of these habitats. At finer scales (0.32-7.16 km2), females selected brood-rearing areas with a greater proportion of wetland habitat with no consequences for duckling survival. However, females that avoided woody perennial habitats composed of trees and shrubs fledged more ducklings. The relationship between habitat selection and survival depended on both spatial scale and habitats considered. Females did not consistently select brood-rearing habitats that conferred the greatest benefits, an unexpected finding, although one that has also been reported in other recent studies of breeding birds. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The 2011 Revised Recovery Plan for the northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis caurina) declared that active forest management is compatible and consistent with recovery goals. The plan indicated that ecologically motivated silvicultural treatments should improve stand conditions, promote forest resiliency, and develop late-successional structural complexity over the long term. Yet most biologists believe that intensive, even-aged silvicultural systems (i.e., clearcut, seed-tree, or shelterwood regeneration methods) degrade habitat for northern spotted owls. Only for the coastal redwood forests of California is it broadly accepted that small-patch clearcut harvest units interspersed within a landscape containing significant large stands of large, old trees can provide adequate habitat. Spotted owls prey upon ground-dwelling prey, such as dusky-footed woodrats (Neotoma fuscipes), in these situations, primarily along edges of 6-30year old clearcuts that contain dense patches of shrubs and hardwoods as well as woody debris. Demographic pressures presumably cause surplus prey to emigrate into adjacent older stands with sparse understories, where they may be more vulnerable to predation by spotted owls. During 5 radio-telemetry studies in both the Klamath and Coastal Redwood Physiographic Provinces, we detected and observed northern spotted owls foraging as far as 600m from forests within harvest-created hardwood/shrub patches that contained scattered conifers and snags. Preferential use of such areas occurred in winter, especially in patches with conifer basal area of 9-18m2/ha that were outside of dense nesting areas. In areas where ground-dwelling small mammals comprise a significant proportion of the owl's prey base, we hypothesize that use of young harvest units with retained conifers may contribute to spotted owl conservation. Such treatments may promote greater prey biomass, which could assist females to attain a high plane of nutrition prior to nesting. This hypothesis should be tested and refined via adaptive management experiments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Many studies have quantified use of established refuges where hunting is not permitted by counting waterfowl or conducting behavioral observations on refuges during hunting season. However, refuge use by individually marked birds remains largely unexplored, along with arrival and departure times, lengths of stay, and nighttime use. We used radio-transmitters and telemetry receiving stations that continuously scanned at 14 waterfowl refuges to test predictions that refuge use would be greatest during hunting hours and on weekends when hunting intensity was expected to be greatest, and that departures would occur in the evening after hunting ended. Movements on and off refuges coincided with sunrise and sunset, which approximated hunting hours. The average length of refuge stay was 12.0 ± 0.5 hours, although some departing birds returned repeatedly to refuges, resulting in longer accumulative stays. Use during the day was greater than at night at most refuges (92.7 ± 18.1 vs. 56.1 ± 10.8 hr, P = 0.03) and was greater on weekends during hunting season than before hunting opened (0.36 ± 0.03 vs. 0.22 ± 0.05, P = 0.01). We also documented nighttime use at refuges with good or excellent food ratings by wildlife managers. Our findings are consistent with the use of refuges to avoid disturbance and suggest that many of these areas provide numerous benefits to ring-necked ducks during fall staging and migration in northern Minnesota.

abstract={If differences in ecological requirements result in juvenile birds using different habitats from breeding birds, then habitat management to protect those birds must protect both breeding and post-breeding habitats. We examined habitat selection by juvenile black-capped vireos (Vireo atricapilla) following their independence from parental care, in 2010-2013 on Fort Hood Military Reservation in central Texas, USA. The black-capped vireo is a federally endangered species that nests almost exclusively in shrub vegetation, but previous anecdotal observations indicate that juveniles may prefer riparian vegetation. We used mist-net capture rates and radio-telemetry to determine relative abundance of juvenile vireos across habitats, to quantify movement patterns and habitat selection, and to investigate how vegetation density and arthropod abundance influenced habitat selection. We captured juveniles at similar rates in shrub and riparian vegetation. Radio telemetry data indicated that juveniles selected riparian vegetation over most other available vegetation types, and tended to stay in riparian vegetation upon arrival. Juveniles selected areas characterized by more canopy cover, denser foliage, and more arthropods. Riparian vegetation provides this combination of features more than other vegetation types, indicating that cover and food are the basis for habitat selection by juveniles. Our results indicate that habitat conservation strategies for black-capped vireos should include protection of riparian vegetation near breeding areas, and more generally, that avian conservation strategies that focus only on breeding areas may potentially overlook other key habitats. © 2014 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2014.},

abstract={Recent advances in radio-transmitter technology have produced sub-gram transmitters which allow small birds to be radio-tracked so that researchers can ascertain information on species movement and behavior to inform conservation and management plans. However, the ability to study some species remains limited by practical problems with transmitter attachment. As a result, improvements in design may be hindered by underreporting of retention rates and attachment issues. We monitored retention rates for glue-attached radio-transmitters on two bird species in southern Ontario with different life histories. Mean retention time for Chimney Swifts (Chaetura pelagica) was ≥25.1 days (± 12.8 SD, n H=H 12, May-Aug 2010 and 2011), while for Bobolinks (Dolichonyx oryzivorus) we estimated mean retention time at under 24 hrs (n H=H 15, May-Jul 2011). We discuss potential reasons for this disparity and suggest improvements to transmitters and attachment methods for short-term use on small birds where tag retention and damage may be problematic, as Bobolinks were capable of removing transmitters and breaking antennas which, in some cases, rendered the devices inoperative. We collated retention estimates from published studies that marked birds with glue-attached radio-transmitters; these studies used a wide range of methods with varying success on different species, however, few studies specifically examined the effects of alterations in glue attachment methods on retention. We encourage researchers to report retention rates to improve the use of resources in other studies and enable advancements that will augment the potential of existing radiotelemetry technology. © Copyright 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

We captured 10 roadrunners (one male and nine females) and fitted each with a 10-g backpack style radio-transmitter. Roadrunners were relocated 2-4 times per week from February-August. We used these data to build a logistic regression model to better understand the vegetative and topographic features important to roadrunners during the nesting season. The initial data set consisted of 30 random and 30 used locations. The best model showed both percent rock and percent litter to be higher at used locations and correctly classified 88% of the sites. Evaluation of the model with an additional 30 random and 30 used locations maintained significance of both the model and variables and correctly classified 83% of sites. Both variables were associated with the location's mesa ridge slopes. Litter dominated locations under shrubs on the ridge tops and slopes and likely provided security from predators, nest sites, and relief from extreme summer temperatures. Percent rock cover characterized locations on ridge tops and slopes which provided perch sites, travel lanes, and foraging sites where the roadrunners could find basking prey. © 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Communal roosting is a taxonomically widespread phenomenon, with considerable variation in patterns of roost dynamics. Some organisms roost together in different locations each night (or day), whereas others roost in traditional locations each night, sometimes switching between roosts in the roost network. The behaviors that drive roost-site selection and the resulting patterns are not well understood. We created an individual-based model that simulates the daily aggregation of organisms into communal roosts. In the model, individuals move according to a movement rule integrating 2 independently adjustable behavioral drivers: roost fidelity, which leads individuals back toward their previous nights' roost, and conspecific attraction, which leads individuals to congregate toward nearest conspecific neighbors. The model predicts that variable levels of aggregation will emerge under different combinations of these drivers, ranging from no aggregation to complete aggregation of individuals into their previous roosts. We tested to see which combination of drivers best predicts patterns of roost use in our study system of Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) in southeastern Louisiana in fall. Using Doppler weather radar data, we show that Tree Swallow roost sites remain consistent from night to night, and the birds return to one of several traditional roosts. Using radio telemetry, we show that individuals switch between these traditional roosts at minimum 22% of the time. Our results suggest that the formation of large communal roosts in Tree Swallows is driven by a combination of moderate conspecific attraction and strong, but not perfect, roost fidelity. © 2014 The Author.},

abstract={Inland dispersal of migrating land birds away from the coast, often opposite to the direction of migration, occurs frequently. Many of these movements may involve migrants seeking improved stopover conditions farther inland, but direct study of inland flights and of the ecological factors influencing their occurrence is limited. We used an automated telemetry array and ground-tracking to assess flight behaviours, survival, and habitat use of young red-eyed vireos Vireo olivaceus during fall migration at a coastal island and an inland stopover site in southwest Nova Scotia. We recorded inland flights for 41% (11/27) of individuals that departed the island. At least 25% of 16 individuals tagged at the inland site also relocated within the landscape prior to continuing migration, but due to the higher proportion of ambiguous flights at the inland site (44%) compared to the island (15%), we could not be sure if actual proportions of relocations differed between sites. Mortality on the island (at least 10 of 39 individuals) was significantly higher than at the inland site (0 of 16 individuals). At mainland sites near the coast where we found 6 of 11 individuals after they relocated away from the island, mortality remained high (2/6). Lack of deciduous canopy cover may have contributed to the high mortality on the island, but coastal mainland sites had a relatively high amount of deciduous canopy cover, similar to at the inland site where there was no mortality. Although coastal stopover sites may be important for migrating songbirds, especially before or after making a large water crossing, our results show that mortality can be much higher, and habitat poorer, at the coast compared to farther inland. Therefore, relocating inland may be an adaptive strategy for individuals that initially settle at the coast and that need to rest and refuel before they continue migration. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Body temperature readings can be a useful diagnostic tool for identifying the presence of subclinical disease. Traditionally, rectal or cloacal thermometry has been used to obtain body temperatures. The use of implantable microchips to obtain these temperatures has been studied in a variety of animals, but not yet in avian species. Initially, timepoint one (T1), nine lorikeets were anesthetized via facemask induction with 5% isoflurane and maintained at 2-3% for microchip placement and body temperature data collection. Body temperature was measured at 0 and 2min post-anesthetic induction both cloacally, using a Cardell veterinary monitor and also via implantable microchip, utilizing a universal scanner. On two more occasions, timepoints two and three (T2, T3), the same nine lorikeets were manually restrained to obtain body temperature readings both cloacally and via microchip, again at minutes 0 and 2. There was no statistical difference between body temperatures, for both methods, at T1. Microchip temperatures were statistically different than cloacal temperatures at T2 and T3. Body temperatures at T1, were statistically different from those obtained at T2 and T3 for both methods. Additional studies are warranted to verify the accuracy of microchip core body temperature readings in avian species. Zoo Biol. 33:452-454, 2014. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Estimates of time spent at migratory stopovers are often used to develop habitat conservation objectives for a variety of avian species, namely waterfowl. Because of limited previous research and a need for accurate conservation planning objectives, we estimated stopover duration and factors influencing stay of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in Illinois using radio telemetry during autumns 2009 and 2010. Total stopover duration of migrating mallards was approximately 68 days and was approximately twice that of previous studies which could have significant implications on habitat needs used for conservation planning purposes. Duration of stay post-capture did not vary by sex, body condition, year, or age but was inversely related to capture date. Our results suggest that wetland conservation objectives could increase 16.2% if our contemporary estimates were included in current planning models of the Upper Mississippi River and Great Lakes Region Joint Venture. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Satellite telemetry has become a leading method for studying large-scale movements and survival in birds, yet few have addressed potential effects of the larger and heavier tracking equipment on study subjects. We simultaneously evaluated effects of satellite telemetry equipment on captive and wild mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) to assess impacts on behavior, body mass, and movement. We randomly assigned 55 captive ducks to one of 3 treatment groups, including a standard body harness group, a modified harness group, and a control group. Ducks in the control group were not fitted with equipment, whereas individuals in the other 2 groups were fitted with dummy transmitters attached with a Teflon ribbon harness or with a similar harness constructed of nylon cord. At the conclusion of the 14-week captive study, mean body mass of birds in the control group was 40-105g (95% CI) greater than birds with standard harnesses, and 28-99g (95% CI) greater than birds with modified harnesses. Further, results of focal behavior observations indicated ducks with transmitters were less likely to be in water than control birds. We also tested whether movements of wild birds marked with a similar Teflon harness satellite transmitter aligned with population movements reported by on-the-ground observers who indexed local abundances of mid-continent mallards throughout the non-breeding period. Results indicated birds marked with satellite transmitters moved concurrently with the larger unmarked population. Our results have broad implications for field research and suggest that investigators should consider potential for physiological and behavioral effects brought about by tracking equipment. Nonetheless, results from wild ducks indicate satellite telemetry has the potential to provide useful movement data. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.copy; 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={North American Ospreys (Pandion haliaetus) typically migrate long distances to their wintering grounds in the tropics. Beyond the general distribution of their wintering range (i.e., the Caribbean, South America, and Central America), very little is known about the wintering ecology of these birds. We used satellite telemetry to determine the duration of wintering period, to examine the characteristics of wintering areas used by Ospreys, and to quantify space use and activity patterns of wintering Ospreys. Adult Ospreys migrated to wintering sites and exhibited high wintering site fidelity among years. Overall, Ospreys wintered on river systems (50.6%) more than on lakes (19.0%), and use of coastal areas was (30.4%) intermediate. Ospreys remained on their wintering grounds for an average of 154 d for males and 167 d for females. Locations of wintering Ospreys obtained via GPS-capable satellite telemetry suggest these birds move infrequently and their movements are very localized (i.e., &lt;5 km from selected roosting areas). Sizes of home ranges and core-use areas for wintering Ospreys averaged 12.7 km2 and 1.4 km2, respectively. Overall, our findings suggest wintering adult North American Ospreys are very sedentary, demonstrating a pattern of limited daily movements and high fidelity to a few select locations (presumably roosts). We suggest this wintering strategy might be effective for reducing the risk of mortality and maximizing energy conservation. © 2014 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

The species abundance distributions from which these indices are derived contain greater detail about community structure. For this reason conservation planners and land managers would benefit from methods that allow more informative comparisons of these distributions than offered by traditional indices. We used bird survey data from four research forests in California to construct rank-abundance distributions. Using bootstrap re-sampling, we created uncertainty bands associated with the empirical shapes of these curves, allowing identification of significant (P<0.05) differences between distributions over a portion of their ranks. We found higher abundances of intermediately ranked species on two of the forests, and ascribe this result to differences in forest productivity and habitat complexity leading to greater niche partitioning of resources. Diversity indices derived from these data were less informative. © 2014 California Fish and Game.},

abstract={Recent research has revealed well over 1000 mtDNA lineages of avian haemosporidian parasites, but the extent to which this diversity is caused by host-parasite coevolutionary history or environmental heterogeneity is unclear. We surveyed haemosporidian and host mtDNA in a geographically structured, ecological generalist species, the house wren Troglodytes aedon, across the complex landscape of the Peruvian Andes. We detected deep genetic structure within the house wren across its range, represented by seven clades that were between 3.4-5.7% divergent. From muscle and liver tissue of 140 sampled house wrens we found 23 divergent evolutionary lineages of haemosporidian mtDNA, of which ten were novel and apparently specific to the house wren based on searches of haemosporidian databases. Combined and genus-specific haemosporidian abundance differed significantly across environments and elevation, with Leucocytozoon parasites strongly associated with montane habitats. We observed spatial stratification of haemosporidians along the west slope of the Andes where five lineages were restricted to non-overlapping elevational bands. Individual haemosporidian lineages varied widely with respect to host specificity, prevalence, and geographic distribution, with the most host-generalist lineages also being the most prevalent and widely distributed. Despite the deep divergences within the house wren, we found no evidence for host-specific co-diversification with haemosporidians. Instead, host-specific haemosporidian lineages in the genus Haemoproteus were polyphyletic with respect to the New World parasite fauna and appeared to have diversified by periodic host-switches involving distantly related avian species within the same region. These host-specific lineages appeared to have diversified contemporaneously with Andean house wrens. Taken together, these findings suggest a model of diffuse co-diversification in which host and parasite clades have diversified over the same time period and in the same geographic area, but with parasites having limited or ephemeral host specificity. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) adult hen and juvenile survival have been shown to have significant influence on population growth rates. However, assessing the sensitivity of population growth rates to variability in juvenile survival has proven difficult because of limited information concerning the potentially important demographic rate. Sage-grouse survival rates are commonly assessed using necklace-type radio transmitters. Recent technological advances have lead to increased interest in the deployment of dorsally mounted global positioning system (GPS) transmitters for studying sage-grouse ecology. However, the use of dorsally mounted transmitters has not been thoroughly evaluated for sage-grouse, leading to concern that birds fitted with these transmitters may experience differential mortality rates. We evaluated the effect of transmitter positioning (dorsal vs. necklace) on juvenile sage-grouse survival using a controlled experimental design with necklace-style and suture-backpack very high frequency (VHF) transmitters. To evaluate the effects of temporal variation, sex, and transmitter type on juvenile sage-grouse survival, we monitored 91 juveniles captured in south-central Utah from 2008 to 2010. We instrumented 19 females with backpacks, 14 males with backpacks, 39 females with necklaces, and 19 males with necklaces. We used Program MARK to analyze juvenile survival data. Although effects were only marginally significant from a statistical perspective, sex (P=0.103) and transmitter type (P=0.09) were deemed to have biologically meaningful impacts on survival. Dorsally mounted transmitters appeared to negatively affected daily survival (βtransmitter type=-0.55, SE=0.32). Temporal variation in juvenile sage-grouse daily survival was best described by a quadratic trend in time, where daily survival was lowest in late September and was high overwinter. An interaction between the quadratic trend in time and year resulted in the low point of daily survival shifting within the season between years (27 vs. 17 Sep for 2008 and 2009, respectively). Overall (15 Aug-31 Mar) derived survival ranged 0.42-0.62 for females and 0.23-0.44 for males. For all years pooled, the probability death was due to predation was 0.73, reported harvest was 0.16, unreported harvest was 0.09, and other undetermined factors was 0.02. We observed 0% and 6.8% crippling loss (from hunting) in 2008 and 2009, respectively. We recommend the adoption of harvest management strategies that attempt to shift harvest away from juveniles and incorporate crippling rates. In addition, future survival studies on juvenile sage-grouse should use caution if implementing dorsally mounted transmitters because of the potential for experimental bias. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Estimates of band reporting probabilities are used for managing North American waterfowl to convert band recovery probabilities into harvest probabilities, which are used to set harvest regulations. Band reporting probability is the probability that someone who has shot and retrieved a banded bird will report the band. This probability can vary relative to a number of factors, particularly the inscription on the band and the ease with which it can be reported. Other factors, such as geographic reporting region, and species and sex of the bird may also play a role. We tested whether reporting probabilities of wood ducks (Aix sponsa) and American black ducks (black ducks; Anas rubripes) differed from those of mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and whether band reporting varied geographically or by the sex of the banded bird. In the analysis of spatially comparable wood duck and mallard data, a band reporting probability of 0.73 (95% CI = 0.67-0.78) was appropriate for use across species, sex, and reporting region within the United States. In the black duck-mallard comparison, the band reporting probability of black ducks in Eastern Canada (0.50, 95% CI = 0.44-0.57) was lower than in the Eastern United States (0.73, 95% CI = 0.62-0.83). These estimates reflected an increase in overall band reporting probability following the addition of a toll-free telephone number to band inscriptions. Lower reporting in Eastern Canada may be because of cultural, linguistic, or logistical barriers. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Long-distance migration is characterized by periods of flight, when energy stores are consumed, and periods of stopover, when energy stores are replenished. The duration of the migratory period is largely determined by time spent at stopover sites. The time constraints imposed on spring migrants should act to minimize the time spent on migration, yet spring migrants often remain at stopover sites for extended periods. We measured the influence of arrival fuel stores, arrival date, and foraging movement rate on the duration of Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) that remained at stopover sites for more than 1 day. We captured spring migrants in mist-nets as they arrived after crossing the Gulf of Mexico. We released them at an inland site and continuously followed (radio-tracked) their movements until departure. Departure time was confirmed with extensive ground searches and aerial surveys. Migrants remained at the stopover sites from 1 to 8 days (2.80 ± 0.14 days). Less than one-third of migrants were transient, leaving the night following release (32 %). Of the migrants that remained more than 1 day, those that arrived with low fuel stores remained longer than those that arrived with more fuel stores. Only migrants arriving early in the spring stayed for extended periods of time (>5 days). Further, migrants that moved faster within the stopover landscape presumably replenished fuel stores faster because they did not remain as long as migrants that did not move as quickly. When arrival fuel stores, arrival day, and departure day were known, we found multiple factors influenced the length of stay at spring stopover sites. Early spring migrants with low fuel stores that moved slowly through the landscape spent the most time at spring stopover sites. © 2014 Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.},

abstract={Surgically implanted transmitters are a common method for tracking animal movements. Immediately following surgical implantation, animals pass through a critical recovery phase when behaviors may deviate from normal and the likelihood of individual survival may be reduced. Therefore, data collected during this period may be censored to minimize bias introduced by surgery-related behaviors or mortality. However, immediate post-release mortalities negate a sampling effort and reduce the amount of data potentially collected after the censoring period. Wildlife biologists should employ methods to support an animal's survival through this period, but factors contributing to immediate post-release survival have not been formally assessed. We evaluated factors that potentially influenced the immediate post-release survival of 56 spectacled eiders (Somateria fischeri) marked with coelomically implanted satellite transmitters with percutaneous antennae in northern Alaska in 2010 and 2011. We modeled survival through the first 14 days following release and assessed the relative importance and effect of 15 covariates hypothesized to influence survival during this immediate post-release period. Estimated daily survival rate increased over the duration of the immediate post-release period; the probability of mortality was greatest within the first 5 days following release. Our top-ranking model included the effect of 2 blood analytes, pH and hematocrit, measured prior to surgical implantation of a transmitter. We found a positive response to pH; eiders exhibiting acidemia (low pH) prior to surgery were less likely to survive the immediate post-release period. We found a curvilinear response to hematocrit; eiders exhibiting extremely low or high pre-surgery hematocrit were also less likely to survive the immediate post-release period. In the interest of maximizing the survival of marked birds following release, hematological data obtained prior to surgical implantation of telemetry equipment may be useful when screening for optimal surgical candidates or informing appropriate response to mitigate potentially deleterious disorders such as acidemia.

We used satellite telemetry to: (1) determine the characteristics (timing, duration, migratory routes) of spring migrations of Ospreys; (2) determine if differences in spring migration patterns existed between sexes and among three breeding populations (east coast, midwestern, and western); and (3) compare consecutive fall and spring migrations of individual Ospreys. The median dates for departure from the wintering grounds and arrival on the breeding grounds did not differ significantly between adult male and female Ospreys. Compared to their fall migrations, all male and all east coast Ospreys spent fewer days on migration, fewer days in stopover periods along the migration route, traveled shorter distances overall, and traveled farther (on average) each day during spring. In contrast, fall and spring migration characteristics of all female and western Ospreys were similar. Our findings suggest that, although sex and breeding location might influence the spring migration strategy used by individual Ospreys, both males and females minimize the time spent on migration to ensure a timely arrival on the breeding grounds to establish or defend a nesting territory. © 2014 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Extra-pair copulation (EPC) behavior is widespread among birds in general, but rarely has been documented among members of the Woodpecker family. Here I report on an EPC observed between a nesting female Picoides pubescens (Downy Woodpecker) and a neighboring male for whom no nest was found. Behavioral observations aided by radio telemetry showed that the female had interacted with both her nesting partner and the extra-pair male on a regular basis in preceding months. This is only the second published account of an EPC in this species within the last 50 years. The circumstances and rarity of the behavior as shown by woodpeckers may lead to a better understanding of its evolutionary function among birds.},

abstract={In 1972 we initiated a long-term study of Peregrine Falcons Falco peregrinus in West Greenland to evaluate population status and describe general breeding ecology. The study area encompassed approximately 6050 km2, spanning the area from the edge of the inland ice cap westward to the coast. From 1972 to 1997, we banded 1896 peregrines (1771 nestlings, 125 adults). Encounters of banded peregrines (n = 114) outside the study area occurred at locations from Greenland to Uruguay. In contrast to the equal sex ratio recorded in broods at banding, the sex ratio of nestling encounters was significantly skewed toward females. The majority (54%) of encounters involved capture and release by other falcon researchers, particularly those operating banding stations along the Eastern Seaboard and in southern Texas. Peregrines from Greenland appeared to reach wintering areas by late October or early November. Although male peregrines wintered significantly farther south than females, there was no significant difference in the mean date of capture along the East Coast of the United States in the hatch year (mean = 9 October ± 2.5 days for males and 9 October ± 1 day for females). Spring migration appeared to commence in early April, with breeding birds back on the study area by late May or early June. Despite the extensive recent use of satellite telemetry, long-term banding continues to play an important role in studies of peregrine migration, natal dispersal, and survival. © The Arctic Institute of North America.},

abstract={We used satellite telemetry in 2004 – 06 to describe the annual movements and habitat use of a segment of the Pacific population of Steller’s Eiders (Polysticta stelleri) that winters at Kodiak Island, Alaska. Information about broad-scale patterns of seasonal distribution and links among annual cycle stages is critical for interpreting population trends and developing conservation strategies. We captured birds in Chiniak Bay at Kodiak Island in late February and early March and monitored the movements after departure from Kodiak Island of 24 satellite-tagged birds: 16 after-second-year (ASY) age class females, one second-year age class female, and seven ASY males. All birds used the same intercontinental migration corridor during spring, but routes and chronology of spring migration appeared to vary by year and among individuals. Sixteen of the 24 birds that were tracked migrated to breeding areas along the Arctic coast of Russia from the Chukotka Peninsula to the Taymyr Peninsula; five birds, assumed to be non-breeding, spent the summer in nearshore waters of Russia and Alaska; and the remaining three birds either died during spring migration or had failed transmitters. Thirteen birds were tracked to molt sites that were broadly distributed along the coast of Alaska. Molt sites included St. Lawrence Island, the Kuskokwim Shoals, Kamishak Bay, and three sites along the Alaska Peninsula. Twelve of these 13 birds returned to Kodiak Island to winter, and a single male wintered on the Alaska Peninsula. Steller’s Eiders marked during winter at Kodiak Island were widely distributed during the breeding season, but a large proportion of marked birds returned to molting and wintering areas in two years of the study. © 2014 The Arctic Institute of North America.},

abstract={Use of high-elevation balds by Nearctic-Neotropical passerines remains a poorly understood component of migration ecology. We used radio-telemetry to assess the habitat use of 20 Oreothlypis peregrina (Tennessee Warbler) at a high-elevation bald during September 2011. Our goals were to estimate the duration of stopover, examine variation in stopover length by age class, and determine patterns of habitat use during fall migration. For radio-tracked birds, the average length of time spent at the bald was 4.6 days (range: 1-12 days). The majority of tracked locations corresponded with heath habitat that surrounded the bald opening (79% of locations), relative to the more distal and less complex, hardwood forest. Collectively, these results provide information on the important, yet ephemeral role that high-elevation balds play in supporting the autumnal migration of eastern North American passerines.},

abstract={The southern New England continental shelf is an important region for black scoters (Melanitta americana) during winter and migratory staging periods and a priority area for developing offshore wind energy facilities. However, little is known about the migration phenology and habitat use of black scoters in this portion of their range and this information is necessary to assess potential risks to black scoters during the marine spatial planning process. In this regional black scoter study over 2 winters, we used satellite telemetry and spatial modeling techniques to estimate migratory timing and length of stay, quantify winter home range size and site fidelity between winters, examine key habitat characteristics associated with core-use areas, and map relative probabilities of use across a 3,800-km2 marine spatial planning area for 2 proposed offshore renewable energy facilities. Black scoters spent nearly 5 months in southern New England, with wide variation among individuals in the size of winter utilization distributions (range 16-12,367 km2). Approximately 50% of the tagged birds returned to southern New England during the subsequent winter and had variable fidelity to core-use areas occupied the previous winter. During both winters, black scoter core-use areas were located closer to shore, at shallower water depths, with coarser sediment grain size and higher probability of hard-bottom occurrence relative to available areas. Resource selection functions classified the majority of a nearshore 5-turbine, 34-km2 renewable energy zone off Block Island as high probability of use by black scoters, whereas an offshore 200-turbine, 667-km2 federal lease block zone was classified as low to medium-low probability of selection. Wind energy facilities, such as the Block Island site, constructed in relatively shallow (&lt;20 m deep), nearshore habitats (&lt;5 km) over hard-bottomed or coarse-sand substrate could displace some foraging black scoters wintering in this region, whereas the larger federal lease block zone located farther offshore is more likely to affect scoters dispersing among core-use areas and during migration between wintering and breeding grounds. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.},

This limited dispersal makes these species an important group for conserving the landscape connectivity. Through telemetry methods, banding individuals, capture-recapture techniques, and visual observations, we evaluated Chestnut-backed Antbird individuals (Myrmeciza exsul, a common nonmigratory understory insectivorous and forest specialist with low mobility), to determine the home-range size in two fragmented landscapes in southwestern Costa Rica. Additionally, we recorded vegetation data in each one detected home area. We found significant differences (t = -3.52, P = 0.002) between landscapes regarding home-range sizes (1.02-2.76 ha at Los Cusingos Landscape [LCL, N = 19] and 0.77-1.80 at Boruca Landscape [BOL, N = 19]). Additionally, average core areas were estimated between 0.14 and 1.08 ha at LCL and between 0.05 and 0.52 ha at BOL. We concluded that Chesnutbacked Antbird home-range size was influenced by vegetation variables such as basal area and tree density, whereas core area was affected by landscape type. © 2014 The Neotropical Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Accurately describing animal space use is vital to understanding how wildlife use habitat. Improvements in GPS technology continue to facilitate collection of telemetry data at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Application of the recently introduced dynamic Brownian bridge movement model (dBBMM) to such data is promising as the method explicitly incorporates the behavioural heterogeneity of a movement path into the estimated utilization distribution (UD). Utilization distributions defining space use are normally estimated for time-scales ranging from weeks to months, obscuring much of the fine-scale information available from high-volume GPS data sets. By accounting for movement heterogeneity, the dBBMM provides a rigorous, behaviourally based estimate of space use between each set of relocations. Focusing on UDs generated between individual sets of locations allows us to quantify fine-scale circadian variation in habitat use. We used the dBBMM to estimate UDs bounding individual time steps for three terrestrial species with different life histories to illustrate how the method can be used to identify fine-scale variations in habitat use. We also demonstrate how dBBMMs can be used to characterize circadian patterns of habitat selection and link fine-scale patterns of habitat use to behaviour. We observed circadian patterns of habitat use that varied seasonally for a white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and coyote (Canis latrans). We found seasonal patterns in selection by the white-tailed deer and were able to link use of conifer forests and agricultural fields to behavioural state of the coyote. Additionally, we were able to quantify the date in which a Rio Grande wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo intermedia) initiated laying as well as when during the day, she was most likely to visit the nest site to deposit eggs. The ability to quantify circadian patterns of habitat use may have important implications for research and management of wildlife. Additionally, the ability to link such patterns to behaviour may aid in the development of mechanistic models of habitat selection. © 2014 British Ecological Society.},

abstract={Age classification is important in understanding aspects of population productivity and dynamics, and making informed harvest management decisions. Since 1994 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has, via the Parts Collection Survey, annually collected a wing from a sample of hunter-harvested band-tailed pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata) across the species' range in the United States to estimate productivity over time. Identification of age composition of the harvest depends on a key to quickly and accurately assign pigeons to age classes with as little as a wing from each pigeon. Existing keys for pigeon age classification do not incorporate more recent published information on timing and sequence of post-juvenal molt. We developed a key in 1994 to classify age (juv, subad, ad) of band-tailed pigeons from wings in North America based on earlier published keys (reported to be accurate 97.3%, on average) combined with information subsequently published on timing and sequence of post-juvenal molt. Our key was applied and the examination procedure refined during our annual examining of pigeon wings for the Parts Collection Survey, 1994-2012. We examined all pigeon wings (1/bird) submitted to the Parts Collection Survey. The mean number of wings submitted annually was 494 (range=114-1,090) from the Pacific Coast population and 79 (range=3-265) from the Interior population. We examined wings during 1 day each year. Each wing was examined by an initial examiner and final examiner (C. E. Braun). We recorded discrepancies in age classification between examiners during 2005-2012. The mean annual number of discrepancies was 3.1 (SE=0.3, range=2-4, n=8) representing a mean of 1.0% (SE=0.2, range=0.4-1.6%) of the total annual sample size. The key has been demonstrated to be accurate and transferable among biologists who have basic training in reading a key and examination of wings (primaries, secondaries, and coverts). Published 2013.

abstract={The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is strongly associated with recently burned forest, which makes it vulnerable to salvage logging or other post-fire forest management that removes snags. As part of a larger radio-telemetry study of the species' resource use and habitat selection in a burned forest in California, we located radio-tagged Black-backed Woodpeckers at night to find and describe their roost sites. We found 14 unique roost locations during night-time searches for five individual birds. Description of the micro-site on the tree that the bird used was impossible at five roosts where we could not visually locate the bird in the dark. At the nine roosts confirmed visually, none of the birds roosted in excavated cavities. Rather, they roosted in sheltered spaces within burned-out hollows of trunks (5 instances), in the crook of a forked trunk (1 instance), wedged between adjacent trunks of two closely spaced trees (1 instance), in a deep, natural bark furrow (1 instance), and clinging to a trunk directly above a horizontal branch (1 instance). Eleven of the 14 roosts (79%) were in dead trees. Our results suggest that in burned forests the Black-backed Woodpecker may benefit if, during salvage logging, emphasis is placed on retaining snags with burned-out hollows, forked trunks, or other relatively unusual structures that may create crevices or other opportunities for shelter.},

abstract={We reviewed band encounter data for Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) and Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) to estimate natal dispersal distances for both species in the coterminous United States (U.S.). We filtered band recovery data to focus on individuals banded as nestlings, encountered at ages old enough to be breeding, and encountered at times of the year when they may be at or near breeding or prospective breeding sites. Our final data set included 96 Golden Eagles and 878 Bald Eagles. Distances between banding and subsequent encounter sites for both species were lognormally distributed. We employed both traditional and Bayesian methods of analysis, and obtained similar results from both approaches. Bayesian analysis of banding data suggest a median natal dispersal distance of 69.2 (95% highest density interval HDI = 63.5-73.1) km for Bald Eagles and 46.4 (HDI = 36.0-55.2) km for Golden Eagles. Median natal dispersal distance for female Bald Eagles 78.3 was (HDI = 35.4-128.6) km greater than for males; we lacked sufficient data to analyze natal dispersal distance by sex for Golden Eagles. Median Bald Eagle natal dispersal distance did not differ among eight regional populations, but there was evidence of a trend toward increasing natal dispersal distance from east to west across the coterminous U.S. Our findings are compatible with natal dispersal data in the literature for both species. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service uses estimated natal dispersal distance of Bald and Golden eagles to set one of the geographic scales at which the effects of permits that authorize the "take" (removal from the wild) of eagles is evaluated. Our analyses suggest that choice of a natal dispersal value in the range of the 50th-90th quantile of the distribution as an effect-area for modeling or effect-assessment for both species of eagle is reasonable. For Golden Eagles, this range is 46-175 km, and for Bald Eagles 69-346 km. © The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Banding of Thick-billed Murres Uria lomvia in the Canadian Arctic was initiated by L.M. Tuck in the 1950s, when he visited three of the largest breeding colonies in Canada. Up to 2010, banding had been carried out at eight of the 10 major breeding colonies, with totals of more than 1000 birds banded at Coburg Island and Cape Hay, Bylot Island, in the High Arctic and at Digges Sound and Coats Island in northern Hudson Bay. Because murres are long-lived birds, large-scale banding can continue to provide useful results for decades. A total of about 89 000 bandings in Arctic Canada resulted in 1757 usable recoveries up to 2010, the vast majority of which were birds killed by hunters in West Greenland or Newfoundland and Labrador. There was no apparent change in the large-scale geographical pattern of recoveries over the period reviewed, but the proportion of bands recovered has fallen. Several periods of higher-or lower-than-expected recoveries can be attributed to particular events: anomalous ice conditions, intensive gill-net fisheries, and oiling at sea. Thus, banding provided a useful tool not only for identifying migration and wintering areas, but also for identifying transient sources of increased mortality. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

abstract={Cuba and its satellite islands represent the largest landmass in the Caribbean archipelago and a major repository of the region's biodiversity. Approximately 13.4% of the Cuban territory is covered by wetlands, encompassing approximately 1.48 million ha which includes mangroves, flooded savannas, peatlands, freshwater swamp forests and various types of managed wetlands. Here, we synthesise information on the distribution and abundance of waterfowl on the main island of Cuba, excluding the numerous surrounding cays and the Isla de la Juventud (Isle of Youth), and report on band recoveries from wintering waterfowl harvested in Cuba by species and location. Twenty-nine species of waterfowl occur in Cuba, 24 of which are North American migrants. Of the five resident Anatid species, three are of conservation concern: The West Indian Whistling-duck Dendrocygna arborea (globally vulnerable), White-cheeked Pintail Anas bahamensis (regional concern) and Masked Duck Nomonyx dominicus (regional concern). The most abundant species of waterfowl wintering in Cuba include Blue-winged Teal A. discors, Northern Pintail A. acuta, and Northern Shoveler A. clypeata. Waterfowl banded in Canada and the United States and recovered in Cuba included predominantly Blue-winged Teal, American Wigeon and Northern Pintail. Banding sites of recovered birds suggest that most of the waterfowl moving through and wintering in Cuba are from the Atlantic and Mississippi flyways. Threats to wetlands and waterfowl in Cuba include: 1) egg poaching of resident species, 2) illegal hunting of migratory and protected resident species, 3) mangrove deforestation, 4) reservoirs for irrigation, 5) periods of pronounced droughts, and 6) hurricanes. Wetland and waterfowl conservation efforts continue across Cuba's extensive system of protected areas. Expanding collaborations with international conservation organisations, researchers and governments in North America will enhance protection of waterfowl and wetlands in Cuba. © Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust.},

abstract={We conducted a 10-year study (1998-2007) of the Mid-Continent Population (MCP) of sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis) to identify spring-migration corridors, locations of major stopovers, and migration chronology by crane breeding affiliation (western Alaska-Siberia [WA-S], northern Canada-Nunavut [NC-N], west-central Canada-Alaska [WC-A], and east-central Canada-Minnesota [EC-M]). In the Central Platte River Valley (CPRV) of Nebraska, we evaluated factors influencing staging chronology, food habits, fat storage, and habitat use of sandhill cranes. We compared our findings to results from the Platte River Ecology Study conducted during 1978-1980. We determined spring migration corridors used by the breeding affiliations (designated subpopulations for management purposes) by monitoring 169 cranes marked with platform transmitter terminals (PTTs). We also marked and monitored 456 cranes in the CPRV with very high frequency (VHF) transmitters to evaluate length and pattern of stay, habitat use, and movements. An estimated 42% and 58% of cranes staging in the CPRV were greater sandhill cranes (G. c. tabida) and lesser sandhill cranes (G. c. canadensis), and they stayed for an average of 20 and 25 days (2000-2007), respectively. Cranes from the WA-S, NC-N, WC-A, and EC-M affiliations spent an average of 72, 77, 52, and 53 days, respectively, in spring migration of which 28, 23, 24, and 18 days occurred in the CPRV. The majority of the WA-S subpopulation settled in the CPRV apparently because of inadequate habitat to support more birds upstream, although WA-S cranes accounted for >90% of birds staging in the North Platte River Valley. Crane staging duration in the CPRV was negatively correlated with arrival dates; 92% of cranes stayed >7 days. A program of annual mechanical removal of mature stands of woody growth and seedlings that began in the early 1980s primarily in the main channel of the Platte River has allowed distribution of crane roosts to remain relatively stable over the past 2 decades. Most cranes returned to nocturnal roost sites used in previous years. Corn residues dominated the diet of sandhill cranes in the CPRV, as in the 1970s, despite a marked decline in standing crop of corn residues. Only 14% (10 of 74) of PTT-marked migrant cranes stayed at stopovers for 5 days before arriving in the CPRV, which limited the contribution of sites south of the CPRV for fat accumulation needed for migration and reproduction. Body masses of cranes (after adjusting for body size [an index of fat]) at arrival in the CPRV varied widely among years (1998-2006), indicating the importance of maintaining productive habitats on the wintering grounds to condition cranes for migration and reproduction. Average rates of fat gain by adult females while in the CPRV remained similar from 1978-1979 to 1998-1999 but declined among males. Distances cranes flew to feeding grounds in the CPRV increased as the percentage of cropland planted to soybeans increased and as density of cranes on nocturnal roosts increased. These results suggest that as habitats of limited or no value to cranes increase on the landscape, more flight time and higher maintenance costs may reduce fat storage. An estimated 40% of diurnal use occurred north of Interstate 80 (I-80) where 5% of lands dedicated to crane conservation are located. Seventy-four and 40% of PTT-marked EC-M andWC-A cranes had springmigrations that included staging in eastern South Dakota for an average of 11 and 10 days, respectively. Cranes of the NC-N, WA-S, and WC-A subpopulations staged an average of 25, 17, and 12 days in central and western Saskatchewan/eastern Alberta. Females in these affiliations increased their fat reserves after leaving Nebraska by an estimated 450, 451, and 452 g, respectively, underscoring the key role of these staging areas in preparing the 3 subpopulations for reproduction. After departing Nebraska, MCP cranes roosted primarily in basin wetlands. Most of these wetlands are in private ownership and lack adequate protection, emphasizing the need for effective laws and policies to ensure their long-term protection. The continued success of the current management goal of maintaining the MCP at approximately its current size and providing diverse recreational opportunities over a wide area of midcontinent and western North America is predicated on the ability of MCP cranes to continue to store large fat reserves in the CPRV in advance of breeding. For the CPRV to remain a key fat storage site, active channel maintenance (e.g., clearing of woody vegetation) likely will need to continue, along with establishing minimum stream flows. These actions would help ensure nocturnal roosting habitat remains sufficiently dispersed to provide cranes with daily intake of high-energy food adequate for major fat storage and limit risk of high mortality from storms and disease.},

abstract={Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a disturbance-dependent species that occupy recently burned forest and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n=28 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n=19 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n=27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian framework (n=5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n=16 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n=8 in habitat created by MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat (mean home range size=79ha) and 2-year post fall prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size=143ha). Home range size was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size=307ha) and was greatest in 3-4year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home range size=430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size=460ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200ha by exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in summer wildfires &lt;200ha and retaining at least 50% of summer wildfires &gt;400ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of ≥27m2 basal area/ha of trees that burned at moderate or high severity, with at least 40% of the basal area composed of trees ≥27cm DBH. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The major winter ranges include the Atlantic, Pacific, and Gulf coasts of the USA and Mexico. Bear River Migratory Bird Refuge at Great Salt Lake, Utah, USA, is a major stopover site, hosting large godwit populations in the spring and fall. Although the distributions of Marbled Godwit populations and their habitats across the landscape are generally known, the linkages between them are not. We tracked 23 Marbled Godwits equipped with satellite transmitters from sites in Utah, Mexico, Canada, and coastal Georgia during 2006-2010. Our goals were to characterize the migration strategy of Marbled Godwit populations and to determine migratory connectivity of major breeding, staging, and wintering areas. We found that: 1) godwits breeding in the western USA and Canada followed an overland route to winter sites in Mexico after departing their Utah stopover site; 2) godwits tagged in eastern Canada migrated across the continental USA and wintered at sites along the Gulf of California, Mexico; and 3) godwits wintering in coastal Georgia bred in North and South Dakota. We believe this to be the first demonstration of a continental "crisscross" migration pattern in a shorebird. We identified differences in migration elements such as distances traveled, timing of migration, duration, residency, and stopover strategy between the subpopulations, but not between males and females. © 2014 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) savannas are economically and ecologically important throughout the southeastern United States; however, deforestation and other land use changes have led to their decline. Fortunately, natural resource professionals have recognized the importance of restoring these ecologically important forests that support a diversity of native flora and fauna. Although efforts are underway to restore longleaf pine savannas, little information exists on Eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) reproductive ecology within these systems. Therefore, we used radio telemetry to investigate Eastern wild turkey reproductive ecology in 2 longleaf pine-dominated forests in southwestern Georgia during 2011-2013. Forty-two percent of nests (n= 78) were successful (≥1 egg hatched) with most nest loss resulting from predation. Five nests were exposed to prescribed fire events (2 were successful; 3 were unsuccessful). Thirty-seven percent of females renested following loss to predation, fire, or other factors. Of these, 43% successfully hatched (≥1 egg hatched). We monitored 34 broods post-hatch. Of the 34 broods, 11 (32%) survived the 14-day flightless period. Of the remaining 11 broods, 7 (64%) survived the following 2-week period (i.e., days 15-30). One of 34 broods was lost to growing-season prescribed fire during the study. Females frequently selected nest sites in areas at the end of their burn rotation (i.e., prior to the next scheduled burn; x-= 613.7. days since burn for all nests from nest initiation date; SE. = 44.7. days). Habitat characteristics at the nest-site and patch-level had little influence on nest survival, suggesting that once a nest site is chosen, nest predation occurs randomly with respect to habitat characteristics. In addition, timing of nest initiation did not significantly improve nest survival. Management of longleaf pine savannas should focus on applying prescribed fire every 1-2. years to maintain native flora communities while enhancing nest and brood cover. Our results also indicate that growing-season prescribed fire has minimal impact on wild turkey production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Translocation experiments, in which researchers displace animals and then monitor their movements to return home, are commonly used as tools to assess functional connectivity of fragmented landscapes. Such experiments are purported to have important advantages of being time efficient and of standardizing "motivation" to move across individuals. Yet, we lack tests of whether movement behavior of translocated birds reflects natural behavior of unmanipulated birds. We compared the routine movement behavior of a tropical hummingbird, the Green Hermit (Phaethornis guy), to that of experimentally translocated individuals. We tested for differences in site selection patterns during movement at two spatial scales (point and path levels). We also compared movement rates between treatments. Behaviors documented during translocation experiments reflected those observed during routine movements. At the point level, both translocated and non-translocated birds showed similar levels of preference for mature tropical forest. At the path level, step selection functions showed both translocated and non-translocated hummingbirds avoiding movement across non-forested matrix and selecting streams as movement corridors. Movement rates were generally higher during translocation experiments. However, the negative influence of forest cover on movement rates was proportionately similar in translocation and routine movement treatments. We report the first evidence showing that movement behavior of birds during translocation experiments is similar to their natural movement behavior. Therefore, translocation experiments may be reliable tools to address effects of landscape structure on animal movement. We observed consistent selection of landscape elements between translocated and non-translocated birds, indicating that both routine and translocation movement studies lead to similar conclusions regarding the effect of landscape structure and forest composition on functional connectivity. Our observation that hummingbirds avoid non-forest matrix and select riparian corridors also provides a potential mechanism for pollen limitation in fragmented tropical forest. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America},

We banded 1114 pelicans on Louisiana barrier islands from 2007 to 2009, tracked their distribution via band re-sighting surveys from 2008 to 2011, and conducted age-structure surveys. Across Louisiana coastal islands in 2011, we detected 7% of pelicans that had been oiled during the 2010 spill and released following rehabilitation. Similarly, 6% of pelicans (not oiled) banded at the same release site in 2007 were observed across coastal islands 1 yr after banding. We observed variation in proportions of pelicans that were 1, 2, and 3 or more years old among years (2008-2011) and across islands, but little variation could readily be assigned to spill-related mortality. These Brown Pelican demographic trends one year following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill are contrary to other assessments of the impacts of oil contamination on marine birds. However, additional research is required to evaluate potential long-term population trends. © 2014 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Background: Given that winds encountered on migration could theoretically double or half the energy expenditure of aerial migrants, there should be strong selection on behaviour in relation to wind conditions aloft. However, evidence suggests that juvenile songbirds are less choosy about wind conditions at departure relative to adults, potentially increasing energy expenditure during flight. To date, there has yet to be a direct comparison of flight efficiency between free-living adult and juvenile songbirds during migration in relation to wind conditions aloft, likely because of the challenges of following known aged individual songbirds during flight. We used an automated digital telemetry array to compare the flight efficiency of adult and juvenile Savannah sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis) as they flew nearly 100 km during two successive stages of their fall migration; a departure flight from their breeding grounds out over the ocean and then a migratory flight along a coast. Using a multilevel path modelling framework, we evaluated the effects of age, flight stage, tailwind component, and crosswind component on flight duration and groundspeed. Results: We found that juveniles departed under wind conditions that were less supportive relative to adults and that this resulted in juveniles taking 1.4 times longer to complete the same flight trajectories as adults. We did not find an effect of age on flight duration or groundspeed after controlling for wind conditions aloft, suggesting that both age groups were flying at similar airspeeds. We also found that groundspeeds were 1.7 times faster along the coast than over the ocean given more favourable tailwinds along the coast and because birds appeared to be climbing in altitude over the ocean, diverting some energy from horizontal to vertical movement. Conclusions: Our results provide the first evidence that adult songbirds have considerably more efficient migratory flights than juveniles, and that this efficiency is driven by the selection of more supportive tailwind conditions aloft. We suggest that the tendency for juveniles to be less choosy about wind conditions at departure relative to adults could be adaptive if the benefits of having a more flexible departure schedule exceed the time and energy savings realized during flight with more supportive winds. © 2015 Mitchell et al.},

abstract={Context Studies assessing welfare issues and efficiency of animal capture methods are important, as capture can pose a significant welfare risk and methods can be time consuming to develop. It is imperative to choose methods that minimise injuries, maximise capture rates and minimise time spent on capture. Aims To test methods of crane capture and tagging (transmitter, colour and metal band fitting), and to compare and develop safe and time efficient methods for capturing brolgas (Antigone rubicunda). Methods We tested three types of noose traps, cannon nets, clap-nets, spotlighting at night roosts and active pursuit of pre-fledged chicks. We also tested two band sizes and two transmitter attachment methods. We compared the success and capture efficiency of these methods and considered welfare issues by comparing the number of injuries and mortalities resulting from these methods. Key results We successfully captured brolgas with noose traps and a cannon net, and by using active pursuit of pre-fledged chicks. Noose traps became more efficient when deployed with call playback and taxidermy decoys. Australian noose traps and active pursuit of pre-fledged chicks were the safest methods with fewest injuries. Conclusions For maximum capture success with minimum injuries to target and non-target species, we recommend noose traps with call playback and taxidermy decoys for capturing adult and juvenile brolgas at feeding areas, and active pursuit for pre-fledged chicks at breeding sites. Noose lines should have elastic at both pegged ends, to avoid injuries. To minimise injuries from tagging, we recommend leg-band-fitted transmitters in preference to harness-fitted transmitters, Australian size 35 bands and colour bands with an internal diameter of 22mm. Implications The use of Australian noose traps with call playback and taxidermy decoys is a safe and time efficient method for capturing brolgas, and is also likely to work for other crane species. Our recommendations can help reduce capture-related mortalities and injuries to brolgas (and potentially other cranes), which is crucial, given the brolga is a threatened species. © 2015 CSIRO.},

abstract={Context The band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata) is a migratory species occurring in western North America with low recruitment potential and populations that have declined an average of 2.4% per year since the 1960s. Investigations into band-tailed pigeon demographic rates date back to the early 1900s, and existing annual survival rate estimates were derived in the 1970s using band return data. Aims The primary purpose of the paper was to demonstrate that the apparent paradox between band-tailed pigeon population dynamics (long-term steady decline) and breeding season survival rates (very high) can be explained by changes in survival probability during the remainder of the year. Methods We trapped Pacific coast band-tailed pigeons during two separate periods: we equipped pigeons with very high frequency (VHF) radio-transmitters in 1999-2000 (1999=20; 2000=34); and outfitted pigeons with solar powered platform transmitting terminal (PTT) transmitters in 2006-08 (n=20). We used known fate models to estimate annual survival rates and seasonal survival variation among four periods based on an annual behavioural cycle based on phenological events (nesting, autumn migration, winter and spring migrations). We used model averaged parameter estimates to account for model selection uncertainty. Key results Neither body condition nor sex were associated with variation in band-tailed pigeon survival rates. Weekly survival during the nesting season did not differ significantly between VHF-marked (0.996; CI=0.984-0.999) and PTT-marked pigeons (0.998; CI=0.990-1.00). Model averaged annual survival of PTT-marked pigeons was 0.682 (95% CI=0.426-0.861) and was similar to annual survival estimated in previous studies using band return data. Survival probability was lowest during both migration periods and highest during the nesting period. Conclusions Our survival estimates are consistent with those of prior studies and suggest that mortality risk is greatest during migration. Weekly survival probability during winter was nearly the same as during the nesting season; however, winter was the longest period and survival throughout winter was lower than other seasons. Implications We present the first inter-seasonal analysis of survival probability of the Pacific coast race of band-tailed pigeons and illustrate important temporal patterns that may influence future species management including harvest strategies and disease monitoring. © 2015 CSIRO.},

abstract={Background: Island breeding birds present an ideal system for studying migratory movements in passerines because their populations are clearly demarcated, and individuals must depart on migration from a single location. The Ipswich Sparrow (Paserculus sandwichensis princeps) is a subspecies of the Savannah Sparrow that breeds exclusively on Sable Island, Nova Scotia, Canada and winters along the Atlantic coast of North America. We used a network of 34 automated VHF telemetry receivers to track radio-tagged adult and juvenile Ipswich Sparrows from their breeding island southward through the first half of their fall migratory journey. Results: We compared adult to juvenile timing and routes. We show that juveniles leave the island approximately 24 days prior to adults and remain temporally separated from them during migration through Nova Scotia. Juveniles have different overwater orientations that result in migratory routes with shorter ocean crossings and a longer overall distance travelled compared to adults. Juveniles also have more frequent and longer stopovers, and displayed some reverse migration. Conclusion: We demonstrate that migratory routes differ between adults and juveniles, suggesting that routes change as individuals age, possibly through learning or social interactions. These differential routes also suggest that sparrows experience risk in different ways with juveniles selecting shorter overwater flights with less navigational risk at the cost of increased time spent in migration. © 2016 Crysler et al.},

abstract={Summary: Reliably estimating the abundance of rare or elusive animals is notoriously difficult. An archetypical example is the endangered Florida panther, whose conservation status is intrinsically linked to population size, but for which reliable abundance information is lacking across its range. This is due not only to the inherent difficulty of sampling a rare and elusive species over a large geographic area, but also because of restricted scientific access to private land. Human interactions with wildlife are a regular occurrence, and interactions with non-scientists constitute an important and underutilized source of information about species distribution and abundance. For example, motor vehicle collisions with Florida panthers are recurrent on the vast network of roads within the public and private lands comprising its range in southern Florida, USA. Capitalizing on a tendency for the public to report collisions with species of concern to wildlife officials, we describe a novel methodology using public reports along with routine telemetry monitoring data to produce the first statistically defensible population estimates for the Florida panther across its entire breeding range. In essence, our approach uses traffic volume and road density to estimate the probability of motor vehicle collision mortality from telemetered animals and models counts reported by the public accordingly. Despite low motor vehicle collision mortality probabilities, our methodology achieved abundance estimates of reasonable precision (29% CV) that was similar to that of previous panther studies using conventional approaches on much smaller study areas. While recovery criteria require establishment of three distinct populations of 240 Florida panthers, we found this single population may never have exceeded 150 individuals from 2000 to 2012. Synthesis and applications. By extracting critical demographic information from underutilized aspects of human-wildlife ecology, our citizen-based approach can cost less than conventional alternatives and could conceivably be used for long-term population monitoring of other species over broad geographic areas, for example from reports of avian wind farm collisions, beached whales or marine mammal boat strikes. An additional benefit is that it can be applied to historical data sets of carcass recovery programmes, in our case permitting abundance estimation over a 13-year period.

Locations were divided into foraging and roosting sites (seven habitat types each) with agricultural fields and fallow land preferred for foraging. We identified 14 roosting sites and characterized the vegetation of six of them. Tumbleweed (Salsola kali) was the predominant plant species at roost sites. Two main threats were detected on wintering grounds: exposure to pesticides and reduced access to water.

abstract={Sexual signals play an important role in mate attraction. In this study, we explore male vocal behavior and female mate attraction in long-tailed manakins, tropical lekking birds where males perform cooperative displays to attract females, and males provide only gametes to choosy females. We monitored female visitation at 37 sites using two techniques: video recordings and automated radiotelemetry. Simultaneously, we used digital recorders to sample male vocal behavior, quantifying vocal output as well as frequency matching and temporal synchrony in male-male duets. We compared male vocal performance to the rate at which females visited male display sites. Video data revealed that both male vocal output and the temporal synchrony of male-male duets were positively related to female visitation, matching our expectations. Telemetry data, in contrast, revealed no such relationship. Our results suggest that telemetry data may yield biased estimates of patterns of female choice, because the tracked females may not adequately represent the pool of potential female visitors to leks. We also demonstrate that male vocal behavior and female visitation vary, in concert, with time of day, peaking in the early morning, with a pronounced drop in the mid-day heat. We compare these results with those of another study, of the same species, in a montane environment with cooler daytime temperatures. © The Author 2014.},

abstract={We examined patterns in the use of landfills (rubbish dumps) in the Chesapeake Bay by Bald Eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). Sites of solid waste landfills (n = 72) were located using state databases. Satellite tracking data from 64 eagles were used to track eagle movements hourly during daylight and once at midnight to determine roosting locations (2007-2012). Landfill use varied significantly with age class, with hatch-year birds using landfills six times more often than adults and twice as often as third- and fourth-year birds. Hatch-year birds spent significantly more time at landfills than expected based on landfill area relative to the study area outside of landfills. The relationship between time of year and eagle presence at landfills was not significant, though the results suggest a peak in landfill use in the late fall. There was spatial variation in landfill use, with 10% of the landfills used by study birds receiving 75% of the total landfill use. Landfills within two km of communal roosts received significantly more eagle activity than landfills farther from communal roosting sites. If eagle presence at landfills is indicative of foraging at these sites, the results provide evidence that foraging strategies in Bald Eagles change with age. Landfills may serve as important scavenging sites for hatch-year and second-year eagles, whereas older birds may be more successful obtaining higher quality prey elsewhere. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Intentional provisioning of food and water at specific locations, commonly bird feeders and bird baths, may alter bird and mammal abundance, distribution, and recruitment; yet no studies have examined the indirect effects of resource supplementation on terrestrial reptilian mesopredators such as rattlesnakes. In the southwestern deserts of North America, anecdotal evidence suggests provisioning birds with food and water attracts rattlesnakes to exurban yards, either indirectly by increasing prey availability or directly through attraction to water. We conducted the first experimental test of this hypothesis by providing bird seed, water, or bird seed and water at 2 national monuments in Arizona, USA, and followed the responses of adult western diamond-backed rattlesnakes (Crotalus atrox) equipped with radio-transmitters, and endothermic prey species, primarily rodents, birds, and lagomorphs. We found differing responses among prey taxa to supplemental food and water provisioning: rodents showed no response to any treatment, birds responded to food treatments, and lagomorphs responded to water treatments. Overall, spatial responses by adult rattlesnakes were weak, but several subjects appeared to respond to individual treatment grids. We did not find evidence of a direct response by rattlesnakes to supplemental water. Overall, we found little support for the prevalent belief that food and water sources at provisioning stations increase local concentrations of rattlesnakes; we provide several explanations for this counter-intuitive result. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

A regional endemic to Panama and Costa Rica, between 250 and 999 individuals appear to now survive mainly within Pacific coastal mangroves and adjacent lowland forest within the Térraba-Sierpe National Wetlands and the Osa Peninsula of Costa Rica, an Alliance for Zero Extinction Site. We used radio telemetry to determine seasonal movements and habitat use and requirements of three Yellow-billed Cotingas at the Rincón River and mangrove estuary on the Osa Peninsula. During the breeding months from approximately December to June, radio-tagged cotingas used mangroves primarily for courtship display, insect feeding, protection from inclement weather, and night roosts. They used lowland forest for feeding on fruit and insects and for infrequent courtship display. Birds fed on fruits from 23 lowland forest tree species throughout the year. Although the female ranged farther than the males during the non-breeding season, no bird showed evidence of migratory behavior. They did not wander from the Rincón mangroves during the non-breeding months from July to November, and they roosted in the same mangrove plot each night. The juxtaposition of mangroves and lowland forest rich in fruit trees may be critical to the survival of the species. © 2015 The Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Background: Migration is a prominent aspect of the life history of many avian species, but the demographic consequences of variable migration strategies have only infrequently been investigated, and rarely when using modern technological and analytical methods for assessing survival, movement patterns, and long-term productivity in the context of life history theory. We monitored the fates of 50 satellite-implanted tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus) over 4 years from five disparate breeding areas in Alaska, and used known-fate analyses to estimate monthly survival probability relative to migration distance, breeding area, migratory flyway, breeding status, and age. We specifically tested whether migratory birds face a trade-off, whereby long-distance migrants realize higher survival rates at the cost of lower productivity because of reduced time on breeding areas relative to birds that migrate shorter distances and spend more time on breeding areas. Results: Annual migration distances varied significantly among breeding areas (1020 to 12720 km), and were strongly negatively correlated with time spent on breeding areas (r = -0.986). Estimates of annual survival probability varied by wintering area (Pacific coast, Alaska Peninsula, and Eastern seaboard) and ranged from 0.79 (95%CI: 0.70-0.88) to 1.0, depending on criteria used to discern mortalities from radio failures. We did not find evidence for a linear relationship between migration distance and survival as swans from the breeding areas with the shortest and longest migration distances had the highest survival probabilities. Survival was lower in the first year post-marking than in subsequent years, but there was not support for seasonal differences in survival. Productivity varied among breeding populations and was generally inversely correlated to survival, but not migration distance or time spent on breeding areas. Conclusions: Tundra swans conformed to a major tenet of life history theory, as populations with the highest survival generally had the lowest productivity. The lack of a uniform relationship between time spent on breeding areas and productivity, or time spent on wintering areas and survival, indicates that factors other than temporal investment dictate demographic outcomes in this species. The tremendous diversity of migration strategies we identify in Alaskan tundra swans, without clear impacts on survival, underscores the ability of this species to adapt to different environments and climatic regimes. © 2016 Ely and Meixel.},

abstract={The breeding season is a demanding period in an individual's annual cycle because it must balance energy gains with the competing demands of reproduction and self-maintenance and properly allocate time and energy to both. To better understand how this balance is reached, nest-attendance patterns, food-provisioning rates, and foraging patterns were studied in radio-tagged Great Egrets (Ardea alba) breeding in a mixed-species colony in Wichita, Kansas, from May-August 2010-2013. A total 900 bird-days for 16 Great Egrets (60 ± 32 days/bird) provided 777 records of feeding sites, yielding travel times, flight velocities, and flight distances. Prey-capture rates, capture efficiencies, prey sizes and aggressive interactions were recorded at rivers, ponds, and weirs. A data logger placed in the colony from 2011-2013 recorded 3,390 arrivals and departures by 14 Great Egrets, documenting nest-attendance patterns. Provisioning intervals (196 ± 18 min [SD]; Range = 30-2,044 min) differed among radio-tagged individuals and among the three years. Round-trip distances to feeding sites in 2011 (16.3 ± 17.8 km) and 2012 (16.0 ± 7.0 km) were both were longer than in 2013 (11.1 ± 3.3 km). Flight distances to feeding sites also differed among individuals and increased with breeding stage. Strike rates (strikes/min) and capture rates (prey/min) differed by year but not by microhabitat. However, capture efficiency (successful strikes/total strikes) differed among microhabitats. Fish captured at weirs averaged six times heavier than those caught at rivers or ponds, but Great Egrets also encountered rates of aggression at weirs five to 10 times higher than at the other sites. A summary of energy gains and expenditures by radio-tagged Great Egrets is described, and differences among individual birds, among years, and across microhabitats is discussed. © 2015, BioOne.

abstract={Darkness comprises more than half of each 24-hr cycle during winter in California's Sacramento Valley, but no studies have assessed nocturnal habitat use by wintering shorebirds at this inland site. From February to May 2013, the day and night habitat associations of radio-tagged Dunlin (Calidris alpina) were compared between post-harvest flooded rice fields and managed freshwater wetlands in the Sacramento Valley. Dunlin had decreasing associations with rice during both day and night from February to April. Dunlin exclusively used rice at night until 25 March, when they shifted to wetlands. During the day, Dunlin were regularly associated with both rice and wetlands until 4 March, and they exclusively used wetlands beginning 25 March. Diel movements by individual Dunlin revealed that birds using rice during the day also used rice during the subsequent night. Our findings suggest that flooded rice, when available, may be more suitable as nocturnal habitat than managed wetlands, and the removal of water from rice fields in February and March causes Dunlin to either use wetlands exclusively or leave the area. Conservation of Dunlin, and likely other migratory shorebirds, may be enhanced by managing the agriculture-wetland mosaic in the Sacramento Valley to ensure that an adequate amount of shallow-water habitats remain during March and April, prior to spring migration.},

abstract={Understanding natal dispersal patterns of animals is critical to development of effective species conservation plans, as it ensures that population management takes place at appropriate scales. The reddish egret Egretta rufescens is a threatened waterbird species lacking documentation on many aspects of its ecology, including movement behaviors at all life stages. We attached satellite transmitters to 25 juvenile reddish egrets on their natal colonies and observed their dispersal patterns and subsequent movements over a period of 115 wk (May 2010-August 2012). Birds exhibited the greatest movement rates in the remainder of the first breeding season (through July 2010, ~10 to 13 wk of age, 11.07 km d-1) and steadily decreased in the post-breeding period (4.87 km d-1) and winter (1.96 km d-1) of their first year. Movements of 1 to 2.5 km d-1 characterized the remainder of the tracking period, suggesting that surviving birds were able to establish local territories. Of the 25 tagged birds, 8 (32%) survived throughout the observation period, based on transmitter failure rates, with losses increasing each winter. The majority of birds remained on the Texas/ Mexico coast of the Gulf of Mexico, indicating that the population is largely resident and therefore vulnerable to coastal habitat alterations in the region. Due to a combination of infrequent long- distance migration, specialized behaviors, and apparent limited gene flow, habitat maintenance should be of primary importance for management of this rare species. This is among the first published studies of heron movement ecology using telemetry, and should be followed by further tracking with developing technologies to characterize high-resolution movements and habitat associations.},

abstract={Energy and other anthropogenic development are increasing throughout the range of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in western North America, and both private and government agencies have expressed concern about indirect and direct effects on Golden Eagles. To facilitate sustainable development and reduce risk to Golden Eagles, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has established guidelines to assist developers in project planning and siting. A major component of environmental impact assessment is documenting Golden Eagle spatial use near a project site before development. Unbiased estimates of habitat selection (spatial use) in and near a proposed project area are possible with location data collected by Global Positioning System (GPS) transmitters attached to a sample of Golden Eagles in the area. During spring 2011, we identified occupied Golden Eagle territories within a study area in southern Idaho, and deployed four GPS and Argos tags on resident adult Golden Eagles. We developed seasonal resource selection functions (RSFs) for each monitored Golden Eagle, and estimated seasonal daytime habitat selection by the average Golden Eagle by averaging predictions from four RSFs. The final RSFs estimated that relative probability of selection by Golden Eagles was highest closer to nests and over moderately rugged terrain. Other predictor variables such as brightness (a measure of non-vegetated habitats) and slope were also seasonally important. Model validation indicated the models reliably predicted Golden Eagle use within the study area. This is the first study estimating Golden Eagle habitat selection based on a combination of GPS and nest locations. The process we developed may be used to improve our understanding of Golden Eagle habitat selection and to provide valuable information to help minimize risk to Golden Eagles from different land management practices. © 2015 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Post-fledging dispersal and site fidelity are poorly understood, particularly for sea ducks that spend the majority of their annual cycle at sea. This is the first description of movements and their timing for first-year (juvenile) and second-year (subadult) King Eiders Somateria spectabilis in relation to their attendant females. We fitted satellite transmitters that operated for 2 years to 63 hatch-year birds and 17 attendant females at breeding areas in northern Alaska in 2006-2009. Our goals were to describe the spatio-temporal distribution of pre-breeding individuals and adult females that had been successful breeders. We also examined fidelity to wing moulting and wintering areas as well as natal philopatry. Juveniles did not appear to follow attendant adults, although they did winter in the same three general wintering areas, suggesting that genetic inheritance and social factors may have roles in the initial migration from the breeding area. Additionally, juveniles were more variable in the timing and duration of migration, moved longer distances during the winter, and were less faithful to moulting and wintering areas than adults, indicating that individual exploration and acquired navigational memory played a role in subsequent migrations. Most (75%) subadult females returned to natal areas, probably prospecting for future nesting sites, whereas subadult males were widely dispersed at sea. Timing and duration of moult migration and wing moult of adult females that were presumed to be successful breeders differed from those of unsuccessful breeders due to the extended time that the former spent on the breeding grounds. Temporal and spatial segregation of post-fledging King Eiders from adults has direct management implications in terms of resource development and population dynamics. ©Published 2014.

abstract={In the last few decades, non-migratory populations of Canada geese (Branta canadensis) have become established in metropolitan areas throughout North America. We banded 1,845 Canada geese in New Haven County, Connecticut, and studied goose survival of geese from 1984 through 2001, a period when local goose numbers increased several fold. Males outnumbered females among adults but not among juveniles. The hunter-recovery proportion (probability that a goose was harvested by a hunter and its band reported to the U.S. Banding Lab) was 0.17 for all banded geese and was higher for males (0.19) than females (0.15). We used the Seber band-recovery model in Program MARK to estimate the annual recovery rate and annual survival rate. The annual recovery rate was 0.22 for all geese and varied by year. The annual survival rate was 0.72 for all geese; survival was higher for females than males and higher for juveniles than adults. Survival rates varied among years and decreased in years with higher winter temperatures or more geese observed during Audubon's Christmas Bird Count. During our study, special hunting seasons in Connecticut targeted non-migratory geese. Despite this, we found survival rates to be at the high end of values reported elsewhere, and the number of geese killed by hunters in Connecticut did not influence survival. Our results suggest that it will be difficult for wildlife agencies to rely solely on hunting to reduce the size of non-migratory goose populations. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={White-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) are important cavity excavators that recently have become the focus of much research because of concerns over population declines. Past studies have focused on nest site selection and survival but information is needed on factors influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average size of 99% kernel home ranges was 125 ha (SD ± 59 ha; n = 19) in the nesting period and 137 ha (SD ± 70 ha; n = 30) in the post-nesting period. Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species. Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82%) or subject to disease (16%). Most burned patches in our study were small (approx. 4.8 ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis. Because home range size was variable and not linked with productivity, it should not be used as an indication of habitat quality without more detailed studies on causal factors that affect space use in this species. © Published 2015.

abstract={Habitat management for northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) should affect vital rates, but direct linkages with survival are not well documented; therefore, we implemented an experiment to evaluate those responses. We conducted our experiment on a reclaimed surface mine, a novel landscape where conditions were considered sub-optimal because of the dominance of non-native vegetation, such as sericea lespedeza (Lespedeza cuneata), which has been reported to provide marginal habitat for northern bobwhite and may negatively affect survival. Nonetheless, these areas have great potential for contributing to bobwhite conservation because of the amount of early successional cover they provide. Our study site, a 3,330-ha reclaimed surface mine in western Kentucky, consisted of 2 tracts (Sinclair and Ken, 1,471ha and 1,853ha, respectively) that served as replicates with each randomly divided into a treatment (i.e.; habitat manipulation through a combination of disking, burning, and herbicide application) and an undisturbed control (n=4 experimental units). Habitat treatments were applied October 2009 to September 2013. We used radio telemetry to monitor northern bobwhite (n=1,198) during summer (1 Apr-30 Sep) and winter (1 Oct-31 Mar), 2009-2013. We used the known-fate model in Program MARK to evaluate treatment effects on seasonal survival rates. We included biological, home-range, landscape, and microhabitat metrics as covariates to help improve model sensitivity and further elucidate experimental impacts. Survival varied annually, ranging from 0.139 (SE=0.031) to 0.301 (SE=0.032), and seasonally (summer, 0.148 [SE=0.015]; winter, 0.281 [SE=0.022]). We found a treatment effect (β=0.256, 95% CI=0.057-0.456) with a seasonal interaction (β=-0.598, 95% CI=-0.898 to -0.298) with survival being higher in summer (0.179 [SE=0.022] vs. 0.109 [SE=0.019]) and lower in winter (0.233 [SE=0.025] vs. 0.355 [SE=0.035]) on treatment than control units. Among habitat covariates, litter depth (β=-0.387, 95%CI=-0.5809 to -0.1930) was the most influential effect (negative) on survival. Additional experiments across a wider range of habitat conditions may be required to determine management intensity or duration thresholds required to elicit greater changes in survival for northern bobwhite populations.

abstract={The greater prairie-chicken (Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) is a grassland bird species of conservation concern, although the region of the Nebraska Sandhills has the largest and most stable population in North America. The Sandhills region is semiarid and dominated by privately owned rangeland; vegetation in the region is typically less dense than the tall grass ecosystem. Most management recommendations for the greater prairie-chicken are based on work in tall grass prairies, so our goal was to estimate the responses of brood-site selection and survival to the unique vegetation characteristics of the Sandhills region. We studied prairie-chickens on private rangelands in Rock and Brown Counties from 2009 to 2011. We radio-marked 139 females and monitored females with broods from May through July using pickup-mounted and handheld telemetry systems. We used discrete choice models to assess micro-scale habitat selection within used pastures. Specifically, we investigated the effect of local heterogeneity of vegetation structure and composition on site selection. The contiguous grasslands of the Sandhills contain variation in soils, slope, and proximity to water table, so we also assessed selection of these ecological sites (the equivalent of land-use categories in fragmented landscapes) for brood-rearing within the broad landscape (macro-scale). Last, we assessed variation in brood survival in response to weather and vegetation structure and composition. Prairie-chicken females with broods selected sands ecological sites (upland, rolling hills sites) that had thicker vegetation with higher visual obstruction reading (VOR; x ¯ =7.7cm, SE=0.4), more variable VOR (x ¯ =20.1, ±2.1), and greater litter depth (x ¯ =0.07cm, ±0.01) than at coupled random locations (VOR: x ¯ =6.6cm, ±0.1; variance VOR: x ¯ =15.6, ±0.8; litter depth: x ¯ =0.05cm, ±0.01). The selection function for brood sites peaked for sites with approximately 10cm VOR, which was significantly less than the range of 20-30cm of visual obstruction suggested for management of tallgrass prairies. In fact, only 5.0% of random sites and 5.4% of sites used by hens with broods had VOR >20cm. However, VOR and litter depth did not explain variability in brood survival, and we found considerable uncertainty in our analysis of daily survival. Models with forb cover were ranked highest in the survival analyses (combined ωAIC <inf>c</inf> =0.63), which provided some support for a positive effect of forb cover on brood survival (β<inf>forb cover</inf>=0.327, SE=0.337). We suggest that land managers in the Sandhills region provide brooding habitat in grazed, upland ecological sites that is characterized by minimal bare ground, a consistent distribution of litter, a forb component, and VOR levels of 4-11cm in pastures in the vicinity of leks. © 2015 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2015.},

abstract={The white-winged dove (Zenaida asiatica) serves an important ecological role as a diurnal pollinator of the saguaro cactus in the Sonoran desert and an economic role as a highly sought after game bird in North America. White-winged doves are intimately linked to anthropogenic changes on the landscape and because of this, have experienced dramatic population fluctuations over the last 75 years in response, both positively and negatively, to anthropogenic changes on the landscape. To understand the factors driving population growth and decline of migratory species like the white-winged dove, it is imperative we study resource use on both their breeding and wintering grounds. To understand how populations are distributed on the wintering grounds, we tested an alternative to band recovery approaches by using stable isotope analysis. Before we could use isotope analysis to link breeding and wintering locations for this species, we first needed to determine if hydrogen (δ2H) and carbon (δ13C) stable isotopes in feather tissue (δ2H<inf>f</inf> and δ13C<inf>f</inf>, respectively) could differentiate among populations of white-winged doves across their breeding range in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. δ2H<inf>f</inf> and δ13C<inf>f</inf> not only differentiated between populations of white-winged doves that breed in the United States, but δ2H<inf>f</inf> also provided further differentiation in white-winged doves that breed in native Sonoran Desert and agricultural habitats in the western portion of their range. Ecological processes associated with desert resources and anthropogenic influences, specifically saguaro cacti and irrigated crops, largely determined δ2H<inf>f</inf> in some white-winged doves in Arizona whereas δ2H of precipitation (δ2H<inf>p</inf>) largely determined δ2H<inf>f</inf> of doves in New Mexico and Texas. This study highlights the usefulness of stable isotope analysis to differentiate populations of animals across the landscape and the insight isotopes can provide into habitat and resource use.

abstract={Understanding migratory connectivity is critical for interpreting population dynamics, seasonal interactions, and for the implementation of conservation strategies of migratory species. We evaluated the migratory connectivity of a Neotropical migratory songbird, the Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapilla) using archival light-level geolocators deployed at two breeding and four nonbreeding locations while incorporating Ovenbird abundance as prior information using Bayes' Rule. We also included band recoveries submitted to the United States Geological Survey's Bird Banding Laboratory to assess connectivity of areas where geolocators were not deployed. We created a probabilistic map of origin for each capture site and mapped spring migration routes between nonbreeding and breeding locations. We found a complete separation of eastern and western populations of Ovenbirds throughout the annual cycle. Breeding Ovenbirds from western Canada spent the nonbreeding season throughout Central America and migrated through central North America during spring migration. Birds breeding in the northeastern United States were distributed throughout the central Greater Antilles in the Caribbean and migrated through eastern North America during spring migration. Fall migration routes were not included because the timing of migration coincided with fall equinox when latitudinal estimates are unreliable. However, longitudinal estimates suggest no overlap between eastern and western populations during fall migration. Ovenbirds with geolocators attached in Jamaica bred in the northeastern United States with the highest posterior probability of origin found in Massachusetts, while Ovenbirds captured in Florida and Puerto Rico bred primarily in the mid-Atlantic. Incorporating Ovenbird abundance as a prior into geolocator estimates decreased the area of origin by 90.37% ± 1.05% (mean ± SE) for the breeding season and 62.30% ± 1.69% for the nonbreeding season, compared to geolocator estimates alone. Ovenbirds exhibited strong migratory connectivity between breeding and nonbreeding season, which has important implications for various aspects of the ecology, evolution, and conservation. ©2015 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={The post-fledging period is a critical life stage for young grassland birds. Habitat selection by recently fledged birds may differ from that of adults and may change as juveniles transition from the care and protection of parents to independence. To describe patterns of habitat selection during these important life stages, we studied habitat use by juvenile Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) in a Conservation Reserve Program grassland in Maryland. We used radio-telemetry to track daily movement patterns of two age classes of Grasshopper Sparrows during the post-fledging period. Sparrows were classified as either dependent (<32-d-old) or independent (≥32-d-old). We characterized the vegetation at 780 vegetation plots (390 plots where birds were located and 390 paired random plots). Microhabitats where dependent birds were found had significantly more bare ground, litter, and plant species richness than paired random plots. In addition, dependent birds were found in plots with less bare ground, more warm-season grass cover, more total vegetation cover, and more forb cover than plots used by independent birds. Plots where independent birds were located also had significantly more bare ground than random plots. Dependent birds are less able to escape from predators because their flight feathers are not fully grown so they may benefit from remaining in areas of greater vegetation cover. However, juveniles transitioning from dependence to independence must forage on their own, possibly explaining their increased use of more open areas where foraging may be easier. To properly manage habitat for grassland birds, management strategies must consider the changing needs of birds during different stages of development. Our results highlight the importance of diverse grassland ecosystems for juvenile grassland birds during the transition to independence. © 2015 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Departure decisions of songbirds at ecological barriers they encounter en route can strongly influence time, energy and survival costs of migration. To date, most field studies of departure decisions and their correlates have used indirect methods and followed migrants at a single stopover site, with limited information on what happens to individuals after they depart from the site. We used an automated radiotelemetry array extending 350 km from southwest Nova Scotia to southern Maine to study the migratory and stopover movements of Northern Waterthrushes Parkesia noveboracensis, Red-eyed Vireos Vireo olivaceus and Yellow-rumped Warblers Setophaga coronata in relation to fuel load and weather at the northeastern edge of the Gulf of Maine. From the 105 radio-transmitters we deployed in southwest Nova Scotia, we recorded 42 landscape-scale stopover flights and 47 migratory flights by 75 individuals. Of the migratory flights, 57% were orientated southwest, a trajectory that, if held, would require individuals to complete a 350-440 km overwater flight. The remaining 43% of migratory flights were orientated northwest, away from the Gulf of Maine, and 15 individuals were confirmed to have detoured around all or a portion of the barrier, as evidenced by their being re-detected over the Bay of Fundy and/or along the coast of Maine between 4 h and 15 days later. Across all individuals, initial fat score had a positive effect on departure probability, especially for individuals that made stopover flights. Among weather variables, tailwind assistance was the best predictor of migratory departures but did not appear to be the main factor determining whether individuals orientated towards or away from the Gulf of Maine. Weather had little effect on departure decisions of individuals that made stopover flights. These differences in the correlates of migratory departures and stopover flights would probably not have been distinguishable had our study been restricted to a local scale. Therefore, our findings highlight the importance of expanding the scale at which departure decisions and the ecology of stopover in general are studied. © 2014 British Ornithologists' Union.},

abstract={Radio-transmitters and light-level geolocators are currently small enough for use on songbirds weighing ,15 g. Various methods are used to attach these markers to larger songbirds, but with small birds it becomes especially important to minimize marker mass and bird handling time. Here, we offer modifications to harness materials and marker preparation for transmitters and geolocators, and we describe deployment methods that can be safely completed in 20-60 s per bird. We describe a 0.5-mm elastic sewing thread harness for radio-transmitters that allows nestlings, fledglings, and adults to be marked with the same harness size and reliably falls off to avoid poststudy effects. We also describe a 0.5- mm jewelry cord harness for geolocators that provides a firm fit for .1 yr. Neither harness type requires plastic or metal tubes, rings, or other attachment fixtures on the marker, nor do they require crimping beads, epoxy, scissors, or tying knots while handling birds. Both harnesses add 0.03 g to the mass of markers for small wood-warblers (Parulidae). This minimal additional mass is offset by trimming transmitter antennas or geolocator connection nodes, resulting in no net mass gain for transmitters and 0.02 g added for geolocators compared with conventional harness methods that add .0.40 g. We and others have used this transmitter attachment method with several small songbird species, with no effects on adult and fledgling behavior and survival. We have used this geolocator attachment method on 9-g woodwarblers with no effects on return rates, return dates, territory fidelity, and body mass. We hope that these improvements to the design and deployment of the leg-loop harness method will enable the safe and successful use of these markers, and eventually GPS and other tags, on similarly small songbirds.},

abstract={Understanding animal movements is fundamental to ecology and conservation, yet direct measurement of movements of birds is both challenging and costly. Raptor behavior and demography are especially difficult to monitor, but models of movement can provide information toward this goal. The golden eagle (. Aquila chrysaetos) in eastern North America is an apex predator of regional conservation concern, and little is known about its population ecology, movements, or behavior. We designed an agent-based model to simulate autumn migration of eagles in Pennsylvania, USA. Inputs to the model included information on regional topography, known flight behaviors (i.e. slope-soaring and thermal-soaring and gliding), estimated uplift, and a principal axis of migration. In total, we modeled 6094 flight routes, averaging 2191 (±1281; ±SD; range: 3-5373) moves. Simulations were spatially comparable to historic flight route data collected via telemetry and generally followed topography that provided uplift. In our model, orographic uplift available to migrant eagles was stronger and more frequent than thermal uplift, and uplift forms were not correlated with one another (. r=. -0.145). Modeled golden eagle migration in autumn follows a narrow-front pattern as individuals are concentrated in areas that produce orographic uplift. Simulated flights were more concentrated on days when historic counts of golden eagles were high at monitoring sites. In contrast, simulations were more dispersed on days when fewer actual eagles were recorded. We used output from our simulations to select new sites that could be used for monitoring migratory raptors. Relatively large numbers of golden eagles were observed at these sites, thus validating performance of our model. This work identifies a novel, cost-effective method for modeling migration patterns of and furthering conservation goals for a rare, low-density raptor species. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Describing and then explaining individual behavior during migration can help us to understand why (on both proximate and ultimate levels) birds migrate; the altitude(s) at which migratory birds fly, for example, can have far-reaching consequences. However, to date, no fine-scale, full-flight altitude data have been available for small (&lt;100 g) migratory birds. We tracked 7 Swainson's Thrushes (Catharus ustulatus) carrying altimeters from takeoff until landing or near-landing during 9 migratory flights. The average recorded flight altitude for the 9 flights was 673.0 ± 523.2 m (mean ± SD); average maximum flight altitude for the 9 flights was 1,199.5 ± 862.7 m (range: 319.22,744.5 m). Initial ascent rates (0.42 ± 0.15 m s-1, n=8) matched predictions; final descent rates were 0.55 ± 0.30 m s-1 (n=5). Contrary to expectations, the thrushes made numerous (9.33 ± 4.42), significant (&gt;100 m) altitude adjustments during their flights (1.44 hr-1), not including initial ascent and final descent. The repeated changes in flight altitude that we observed should cause these birds to use more energy than they would if they flew at or near a single altitude for several hours at a time. We speculate that these altitude modifications may result from variation in atmospheric conditions or from the birds descending toward anthropogenic light sources during the flights. © 2015 American Ornithologists' Union.},

abstract={The Atlantic population of Canada Geese (Branta canadensis) nests in the coastal lowlands of eastern Hudson Bay and southwestern Ungava Bay in Nunavik, Quebec. Although many aspects of the nesting ecology of this and other northern populations of Canada Geese have been studied and published, there is a paucity of information on the use of brood-rearing and moulting sites. Based on 18 years of band and recapture data from an ongoing banding program, this paper presents the distribution of brood-rearing and moulting sites and the use of these sites over time. Along Hudson Bay and Ungava Bay, the most important brood-rearing and moulting areas are the stretch of coastal lowlands between the Mariet River and Shallow Bay and between Riviere aux Feuilles and Virgin Lake, respectively. Of all adult geese captured during the banding program (h = 41 924), 7.5% (standard error [SE] 0.13%) were recaptures, that is, birds that had previously been caught and banded; annual recapture rates ranged from 5.1% to 11.4%. The mean and median distances between the site of first recapture and the original site of capture were 4.3 km (SE 0.22 km) and 1.5 km, respectively. Juveniles moved, on average, 5.4 km farther than adults and males moved 1.4 km farther than females. Among geese banded as juveniles, males moved twice as far as females: 11.5 km versus 5.7 km.},

abstract={The Canadian Migration Monitoring Network (CMMN) consists of standardized observation and migration count stations located largely along Canada's southern border. A major purpose of CMMN is to detect population trends of migratory passerines that breed primarily in the boreal forest and are otherwise poorly monitored by the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS). A primary limitation of this approach to monitoring is that it is currently not clear which geographic regions of the boreal forest are represented by the trends generated for each bird species at each station or group of stations. Such information on "catchment areas" for CMMN will greatly enhance their value in contributing to understanding causes of population trends, as well as facilitating joint trend analysis for stations with similar catchments. It is now well established that naturally occurring concentrations of deuterium in feathers grown in North America can provide information on their approximate geographic origins, especially latitude. We used stable hydrogen isotope analyses of feathers (δ2Hf) from 15 species intercepted at 22 CMMN stations to assign approximate origins to populations moving through stations or groups of stations. We further constrained the potential catchment areas using prior information on potential longitudinal origins based upon bird migration trajectories predicted from band recovery data and known breeding distributions. We detected several cases of differences in catchment area of species passing through sites, and between seasons within species. We discuss the importance of our findings, and future directions for using this approach to assist conservation of migratory birds at continental scales. © 2015 by the author(s).},

abstract={Local abiotic conditions (microclimates) vary spatially and selection of favorable microclimates within a habitat can influence an animal's energy budgets, behavior, and ultimately, fitness. Insectivorous birds that inhabit the understory of tropical forests may be especially sensitive to environmental variation and may select habitat based on microclimatic (e.g. temperature, humidity, light) conditions. Sensitivity to microclimate could contribute to the population declines of understory insectivores in response to forest fragmentation or degradation, which changes the physical structure of the forest, thereby increasing light intensity and temperature and decreasing humidity. To understand the role of microclimates in the habitat selection of understory insectivores, we characterized the microclimatic associations of nine species of understory insectivores at three sites along a precipitation gradient and across seasons in central Panama. We compared the distributions of microclimates selected by birds with microclimates at randomly chosen points within their home ranges to test for microclimate selectivity. We predicted that: (1) birds would select microclimates that are more humid, cooler, and less bright than random microclimates, (2) selectivity would be greater in hotter, drier habitats and (3) selectivity would be greatest in the dry season. We found no evidence of selectivity for the nine species we sampled on a seasonal or spatial basis. Microclimate variation was minimal in the forest understory at all sites, particularly in the wet season. Understory insectivores did not use microhabitats characterized by high light intensity, and may be sensitive to light, though the mechanism remains unclear. The lack of microclimate variation in the understory of tropical forests may have serious fitness consequences for understory insectivores due to increasing temperatures associated with climate change coupled with a lack of thermal refugia. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Knowledge of the distribution and movements of populations of migratory birds is useful for the effective conservation and management of biodiversity. However, such information is often unavailable because of the difficulty of tracking sufficient numbers of individuals. We used more easily obtained feather stable hydrogen isotope ratios (δ2H) to predict the summer grounds of the small, threatened, and migratory population of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in eastern North America. We then identified summer locations and the extent of migratory connectivity for this population. We collected δ2 H(δ2H<inf>f</inf>), stable carbon isotope (δ13C), and stable nitrogen isotope (δ15N) data from the body feathers of 47 juvenile, subadult, and adult Golden Eagles. Values of δ13C and δ15N suggested that all but 2 birds obtained food from terrestrial-based food webs and therefore that δ2 data were appropriate for inferring the geographic region of molt for the majority of birds. There was relatively large interfeather variation in the δ2H values of subadults vs. adults, suggesting that these groups molted at different times and places. The most negative δ2H<inf>f</inf> values from birds with known summering grounds exhibited (1) a negative correlation with their summering latitude, and (2) a positive correlation with amount-weighted δ2H values of May-August precipitation at the summer location. These data validate the use of δ2H<inf>f</inf> values for inferring the summer locations of Golden Eagles of unknown origin. Likelihoodof-origin maps derived from δ2H<inf>f</inf> values revealed that (1) the majority of birds spent the breeding season in central Québec and Labrador, and (2) birds that wintered at southern latitudes, from approximately northern Alabama to southwestern Virginia, migrated about twice the distance of birds that wintered at northern latitudes, from Pennsylvania to New York. We observed a positive relationship between δ2H<inf>f</inf> values and the latitude of the wintering location, which, along with the likelihood-of-origin maps, revealed moderate patterns of leapfrog migration and migratory connectivity. © 2015 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

From 2010–2013 we radio-tracked 53 ratsnakes in the fragmented region of central Missouri. We relocated each snake 4× per week and used movement frequency as an index of activity. We used generalized linear mixed models within an information–theoretic approach to evaluate temporal and weather variables as potential predictors of snake activity. While snakes were generally sedentary, activity showed a linear response to relative humidity and a quadratic response to air temperature, peaking near 30 °C. Seasonal activity patterns differed between sexes and among years, but snakes were generally least active in mid-summer, regardless of weather. Our findings provide strong evidence that air temperature and relative humidity differentially affect activity patterns of an important predator and are the mechanism explaining increased nest predation rates with warmer temperatures. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg (outside the USA).},

abstract={Stopover behavior of migrant birds is influenced by their energetic condition, but also by extrinsic factors, including weather conditions and habitat attributes such as vegetation structure, microclimates, predation pressure, competition, and food availability. Anthropogenic habitats may differ from natural habitats in these attributes, which could promote differing stopover behaviors for migrants in the two habitat types and affect overall habitat suitability. We used radio-telemetry to measure stopover behaviors of fall migrant yellow-rumped warblers Setophaga coronata in native riparian corridor woodlands (corridors) and anthropogenic woodlots (woodlots) in the Northern Prairie region. We measured stopover duration, movement rate, and temporary home range size for birds in both habitat types by attaching radio-transmitters and relocating birds to either corridor (n = 17) or woodlot (n = 16) study sites. We used AICC to rank null, global, and reduced models, which included habitat type, energetic condition, habitat size, year, date, and movement rate (for stopover duration analyses only) as explanatory variables. Model rankings showed that habitat type was not included in any of the top models (ΔAICC &lt; 2) for movement behavior, temporary home range size, or stopover duration, which suggests similar functional habitat quality between the two habitat types. These data add similar behavioral responses for birds in the two habitat types to similar fattening rates and stress physiology, further confirming similar suitability of native and anthropogenic woodland habitats in this region as stopover habitat. We also applied logistic regression with a model selection approach, including cloud cover, tail wind component, temperature, and barometric pressure as independent variables, and departure decision as the dependent variable, to evaluate the effects of weather variables on departure. Model selection suggested that cloud cover is a prominent factor affecting departure decisions and the other variables may also influence departure decisions of yellow-rumped warblers from inland stopover sites. © 2015 Nordic Society Oikos.},

abstract={The population of Common Terns (Sterna hirundo) in Barnegat Bay, New Jersey, USA, has recently experienced poor productivity with complete or near-complete breeding failure at multiple colonies, and the number of breeding pairs has declined. Adult Common Terns were captured and banded at Pettit Island from 2010 through 2014 and at four additional islands from 2011 through 2014. Although the number of breeding pairs on Pettit Island decreased and reproductive success was generally poor, this colony was more productive than the other colonies. Data from the other colonies were too sparse to treat each site separately, and the analysis is instead based on two "locations": Pettit Island and all other sites. Apparent survival and movement probabilities were estimated using multistate capture-recapture modeling based on recaptures combined with resighting of color-banded Common Terns. The two best supported models included location, transience, and presence or absence of color bands as variables and produced very similar parameter estimates. Adult survival at Pettit Island was estimated at approximately 0.88, which is within the range of previous estimates for Common Terns. Survival estimates for the other sites had high uncertainty but appeared to be very low, at approximately 0.71. There was no evidence that apparent survival changed across time (2010-2012 compared to 2012-2014). Movement probabilities suggest a frequency of breeding dispersal within Barnegat Bay above 6%. Detection probabilities were much higher for color-marked birds than for those with metal bands only. Low apparent survival and decreases in the number of adults probably reflect permanent emigration out of the study area. The most likely cause of this decline in the Barnegat Bay population is frequent flooding due to sea level rise and severe storms. © 2015, The Waterbird Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Bird conservation Joint Ventures are collaborative partnerships between public agencies and private organizations that facilitate habitat management to support waterfowl and other bird populations. A subset of Joint Ventures has developed energetic carrying capacity models (ECCs) to translate regional waterfowl population goals into habitat objectives during the non-breeding period. Energetic carrying capacity models consider food biomass, metabolism, and available habitat to estimate waterfowl carrying capacity within an area. To evaluate Joint Venture ECCs in the context of waterfowl space use, we monitored 33 female mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) and 55 female American black ducks (A. rubripes) using global positioning system satellite telemetry in the central and eastern United States. To quantify space use, we measured first-passage time (FPT: time required for an individual to transit across a circle of a given radius) at biologically relevant spatial scales for mallards (3.46 km) and American black ducks (2.30 km) during the non-breeding period, which included autumn migration, winter, and spring migration. We developed a series of models to predict FPT using Joint Venture ECCs and compared them to a biological null model that quantified habitat composition and a statistical null model, which included intercept and random terms. Energetic carrying capacity models predicted mallard space use more efficiently during autumn and spring migrations, but the statistical null was the top model for winter. For American black ducks, ECCs did not improve predictions of space use; the biological null was top ranked for winter and the statistical null was top ranked for spring migration. Thus, ECCs provided limited insight into predicting waterfowl space use during the non-breeding season. Refined estimates of spatial and temporal variation in food abundance, habitat conditions, and anthropogenic disturbance will likely improve ECCs and benefit conservation planners in linking non-breeding waterfowl habitat objectives with distribution and population parameters.

abstract={Resident (non-migratory) Canada goose (Branta canadensis) populations in suburban environments pose risks to human health and safety. Specifically, the relatively large size and gregarious behavior of geese combined with an overlap in aircraft flight space pose substantial risk of property damage and human fatalities from goose-aircraft collisions. We estimated home range and core use areas of resident Canada geese and evaluated goose movements to better define the risk of goose-aircraft collisions around Piedmont Triad International Airport in Greensboro, North Carolina, USA. We placed satellite transmitters on 16 of 763 neck- and leg-banded geese to identify and track individuals over an 18-month study period. The frequency of satellite-tagged goose movements peaked daily within the first 2 hours after sunrise (28.1%) and again near sunset (27.2%). All in-flight goose movements occurred ≤64 m above ground level. Geese flying at these altitudes posed a risk to aircraft in the take-off and landing phases of flight. For all in-flight movements, the number of movements per day was 0.13 during the molt (1 Jun-15 Jul), 0.42 during early post-molt 2008 (16 Jul-31 Oct), 0.36 during late post-molt (1 Nov-31 Jan), 0.58 during breeding/nesting (1 Feb-31 May), and 0.58 during the early post-molt 2009. Satellite-tagged geese traveled a mean distance ranging from 2.0 km (SE = 0.3) to 4.9 km (SE = 0.4) per day, depending on sex and season, which supports the need for intensive goose management within a minimum distance of 8 km from airports. Mean fixed 95% kernel home range and 50% core use area were 991.8 ha (SE = 241.1) and 120.4 ha (SE = 24.6), respectively. Additionally, we monitored site recolonization of nuisance geese after the controlled removal of 60 resident geese from 1 site, which eliminated 24.2% of those initially banded at the site in 2008, but other geese began to recolonize the site within 27 days. Rapid recolonization of the removal site suggests that lethal removal should be conducted at all molt locations within a minimum distance of 8 km of suburban airports and any additional removal or management resources should be applied to greater distances to prevent recolonization of these sites by geese in close proximity to the removal site. © Published 2015.

abstract={Conservation planning for spotted owls (Strix occidentalis) hinges upon retaining late-successional and old-growth forests. This strategy is to be supplemented over time by creating structural conditions found in such forests using innovative silviculture in less well-developed forests. Recent research indicates that spotted owls often hunt for prey or may nest in relatively young or mid-seral forest stands that were thinned or partially harvested in previous decades, but little information has been available to evaluate short-term direct responses (&lt;5year) by spotted owls to such practices. We used selection ratios to compare the frequency of nocturnal use by radio-tagged northern spotted owls (S.o. caurina) and California spotted owls (S.o. occidentalis) ≤2years before and ≤2years after 150 forest stands were thinned or partially harvested within 1200m of nest sites of 19 owl home ranges in 5 study areas in western Oregon and northern California. We used logistic regression to investigate habitat and environmental factors that distinguished between 89 stands that were used and 115 stands that were not found used by radio-tagged owls for up to 2years after treatment via a broad range of partial-harvest or thinning prescriptions within 2400m of nest sites. Before harvest, radio-tagged owls generally used stands scheduled for harvest treatment in proportions significantly less than availability. After harvesting, selection ratios increased (n=4), remained the same (n=4), or decreased (n=2) among 10 owl pairs for which we acquired sufficient telemetry data both before and after harvesting. Across all owls and all post-harvest conditions, the overall selection ratio increased after harvesting, suggesting that many of the harvests were benign or may have resulted in improved habitat. The probability of use of thinned or partially-harvested stands increased with harvest-unit size, decreased with distance from nest sites, and varied with the intensity of harvest and among forest types as represented by study areas. We found only limited evidence for a positive effect of retained basal area of large trees (≥66cm diameter at breast height [dbh]), probably because many treated stands contained no such large trees prior to harvest. We found a quadratic relationship with retained basal area of mid-story conifers (10-65cmdbh), such that harvested stands that contained 25-35m2/ha basal area of such mid-story trees were more likely to be used, holding other factors constant at their means. We also found evidence for a positive influence of proximity to riparian zones on probability of use of harvested stands. Although we did not obtain information on prey abundance or foraging efficiency, our study suggests that judicious applications of partial-harvest forestry, primarily commercial thinning, have the potential to improve foraging habitats for spotted owls. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Why do females faced with the same array of potential mates often select different males? Variation in choosiness, defined as investment in mate search, is an important potential source of variation in mating decisions. Experimental work suggests such variation is driven by the costs of searching, but data from natural populations are scarce and few studies have addressed explicitly the counteracting benefits expected from search investment. We tracked male visitation behavior of free-ranging females on a lek of lance-tailed manakins (Chiroxiphia lanceolata) using automated telemetry at dispersed male display sites. We assessed relationships of female age, experience, body condition, and parasite load with variation in choosiness, quantified as males visited, number of visits, and visit duration. Young females visited more males and made more total visits before choosing a mate, whereas older females conducted longer visits for first nests of the year. Renesting females searched less, but the few monitored females mating faithfully between years nevertheless sampled several males. We found little support for effects of condition on choosiness. Results suggest females sample more widely when they lack information about the distribution of available mates. Though previous work in the study population has shown both female preference for and offspring fitness benefits from heterozygous sires, genetic tests of paternity revealed choosier females did not choose more heterozygous mates. Females' investment in mate search varied in relation to their own age and within-year experience, but mate search investment did not independently determine variation in choice among individuals. © 2015 The Author 2015.

abstract={Supplementing wildlife populations with resources during times of limitation has been suggested for many species. The focus of our study was to determine responses of northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; Linnaeus) and scaled quail (Callipepla squamata; Vigors) to artificial surface-water sources in semiarid rangelands. From 2012-2014, we monitored quail populations via radio telemetry at Beaver River Wildlife Management Area, Beaver County, Oklahoma. We used cumulative distribution functions and resource utilization functions (RUFs) to determine behavioral responses of quail to water sources. We also used Program MARK to determine if water sources had any effect on quail vital rates. Our results indicated that both northern bobwhite and scaled quail exhibited behavioral responses to the presence of surface-water sources. Northern bobwhite selected for areas < 700 m and < 650 m from water sources during the breeding and nonbreeding season, respectively. However, the nonbreeding season response was weak ( =-0.06, SE = < 0.01), and the breeding season ( = 0.01, SE = 0.02) response was nonsignificant on the basis of RUFs. Scaled quail selected for areas < 650 m and < 250 m from water sources during the breeding and nonbreeding season, respectively. The breeding season RUF ( =-0.31, SE = 0.07) indicated a stronger response for scaled quail than bobwhite. Conversely, there was no direct effect of surface water on quail vital rates or nest success during the course of our study. Although water may affect behavioral patterns of quail, we found no evidence that it affects quail survival or nest success for these two species. © 2015 Society for Range Management.

Adults moved southwest, crossing the Gulf of Maine (GOM), consistent with the commencement of migration hypothesis. Hatch-year birds exhibited less directional movements constrained geographically by the GOM.

abstract={Buff-breasted Sandpipers Calidris subruficollis are a species of significant conservation concern. Previous work shows densities are high during stopover in the Rainwater Basin of Nebraska, USA during the northward migration. However, one of the challenges for understanding the relationship between density at a given time and total numbers of birds using the area during a season is the lack of information about individual stopover duration. We used radio-telemetry to estimate stopover duration in the Rainwater Basin during 2006–2008. Based on information from 24 tagged individual birds, Buff-breasted Sandpiper stopover duration in the Rainwater Basin is ca. 24–48 hours for most individuals. To place our results in the spatial and temporal context of spring migration through the Great Plains of North America, we summarized information on Buff-breasted Sandpipers available from eBird and other online sources. This summary indicates that migration northward occurs rapidly after birds leave stopover sites in coastal Louisiana and Texas, and that there are several areas in a narrow band in the eastern Great Plains where concentrations of Buff-breasted Sandpipers occur. Overall, our results support two primary conclusions about the role of the Rainwater Basin during spring migration. First, we confirm earlier reports that this species occurs in exceptionally high densities in the Rainwater Basin, relative to other areas where the species stops on its way north. Second, individuals spend a short amount of time in the Rainwater Basin and appear to arrive in good physical condition. Their time in the Rainwater Basin is spent interacting with conspecifics and maintaining good migratory condition, but evidence suggests that pre-migratory and pre-breeding fattening may occur primarily at sites south of the Rainwater Basin. The short duration of stopover, relative to the amount of time the species is present in the Rainwater Basin, suggests the total number of individuals using the region is greater than previous estimates based on density at a given point of time. © 2015, International Wader Study Group.

abstract={The Andean Cordillera is notable for numerous centers of avian endemism along its great length. Yet, the narrow band of humid montane forest in eastern Ayacucho in south-central Peru is not known to harbor endemic bird species despite its position between two putative biogeographic barriers: the arid Apurímac and Mantaro river valleys. We report the first documented records of the endemic Ayacucho subspecies of Vilcabamba Thistletail, Asthenes vilcabambae ayacuchensis since its initial discovery and collection in 1968-1970. Unexpectedly, the previously unknown song of A. v. ayacuchensis is more similar to Eye-ringed Thistletail Asthenes palpebralis of Junín Department than to nominate A. v. vilcabambae of western Cuzco Department. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences reinforce vocal evidence, and support that A. v. ayacuchensis is more closely related to A. palpebralis and the Rusty-fronted Canastero A. ottonis than to A. v. vilcabambae. Based on distinct vocalizations, phylogeny, and diagnosable plumage characters, ayacuchensis merits species recognition. The "Ayacucho Thistletail" is documented certainly from elfin forest localities in three small valleys in the Apurímac drainage in eastern Ayacucho. There are no protected areas or reserves that overlap A. ayacuchensis' limited distribution and we suspect that it, like many elfin-forest specialists in the Andes, is threatened by anthropogenic habitat modification. © 2015 The Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Long-distance migratory shorebirds are vulnerable to stressors throughout their annual cycle, including during migration when they must rely on a limited set of stopover sites to refuel. The rufa subspecies of Red Knot Calidris canutus has shown drastic population declines in recent decades and is listed as Endangered in Canada and Threatened in the United States. Recent evidence from light-level geolocators suggested that the subspecies might use a previously unknown remote stopover site on the west coast of Hudson Bay near the Nelson River, but total numbers of knots using the area and the specific locations and habitats used were unknown. In spring 2014, we performed ground and aerial surveys of coastal areas surrounding the Nelson River to assess shorebird use and abundance. In addition, we used radio telemetry to investigate migratory connectivity between the Nelson River and an important stopover site at Delaware Bay, New Jersey. Red Knots were the second-most abundant species observed during ground surveys, and we counted a total of 4,259 knots during a two-day aerial survey, representing about 10% of the estimated rufa population. At least 16 knots with radio-tags out of 87 banded at Delaware Bay were detected near the Nelson River, suggesting strong migratory connectivity between the two stopover sites. Based on our observations of knots and other shorebirds, the site qualifies as an Important Bird Area (IBA) and Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network (WHSRN) site under several criteria. Understanding the potential impacts of threats in the area, including hydroelectric development on the Nelson River and overabundant Snow Geese Chen caerulescens caerulescens, is a critical next step in protecting the rufa subspecies from further declines. © 2015, International Wader Study Group.

abstract={During annual migrations between breeding and nonbreeding grounds, billions of land birds encounter migratory barriers en route. Although birds are thought to be more selective (i.e., cross under favorable wind conditions) and spend more time refueling at stopover sites when confronted with these barriers, there is no direct evidence to support these hypotheses. Using 2 automated radio-telemetry arrays at stopover sites situated before (south of) and after (north of) a large ecological barrier (Lake Erie), we tracked departure decisions of American redstarts Setophaga ruticilla and yellow-rumped (myrtle) warblers Setophaga coronata coronata during spring migration. We found evidence that condition, age, and tailwind assistance were all positively correlated with the likelihood of departure. Interestingly, these patterns did not differ between species, with presumably differing migratory tactics, nor across sites, suggesting that during spring migration, migratory songbirds may follow general rules for departure from stopover sites, despite varying ecological and life-history contexts. © The Author 2015.

abstract={Successful conservation of migratory birds demands we understand how habitat factors on the breeding grounds influences breeding success. Multiple factors are known to directly influence breeding success in territorial songbirds. For example, greater food availability and fewer predators can have direct effects on breeding success. However, many of these same habitat factors can also result in higher conspecific density that may ultimately reduce breeding success through density dependence. In this case, there is a negative indirect effect of habitat on breeding success through its effects on conspecific density and territory size. Therefore, a key uncertainty facing land managers is whether important habitat attributes directly influence breeding success or indirectly influence breeding success through territory size. We used radio-telemetry, point-counts, vegetation sampling, predator observations, and insect sampling over two years to provide data on habitat selection of a steeply declining songbird species, the Canada Warbler (Cardellina canadensis). These data were then applied in a hierarchical path modeling framework and an AIC model selection approach to determine the habitat attributes that best predict breeding success. Canada Warblers had smaller territories in areas with high shrub cover, in the presence of red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus), at shoreline sites relative to forest-interior sites and as conspecific density increased. Breeding success was lower for birds with smaller territories, which suggests competition for limited food resources, but there was no direct evidence that food availability influenced territory size or breeding success. The negative relationship between shrub cover and territory size in our study may arise because these specific habitat conditions are spatially heterogeneous, whereby individuals pack into patches of preferred breeding habitat scattered throughout the landscape, resulting in reduced territory size and an associated reduction in resource availability per territory. Our results therefore highlight the importance of considering direct and indirect effects for Canada warblers; efforts to increase the amount of breeding habitat may ultimately result in lower breeding success if habitat availability is limited and negative density dependent effects occur. © 2016 by the author(s).},

abstract={Migration is costly in terms of time, energy and safety. Optimal migration theory suggests that individual migratory birds will choose between these three costs depending on their motivation and available resources. To test hypotheses about use of migratory strategies by large soaring birds, we used GPS telemetry to track 18 adult, 13 sub-adult and 15 juvenile Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos in eastern North America. Each age-class had potentially different motivations during migration. During spring, the migratory performance (defined here as the directness of migratory flight) of adults was higher than that of any other age-classes. Adults also departed earlier and spent less time migrating. Together, these patterns suggest that adults were primarily time-limited and the other two age-classes were energy-limited. However, adults that migrated the longest distances during spring also appeared to take advantage of energy-conservation strategies such as decreasing their compensation for wind drift. During autumn, birds of all age-classes were primarily energy-minimizers; they increased the length of stopovers, flew less direct routes and migrated at a slower pace than during spring. Nonetheless, birds that departed later in autumn flew more directly, indicating that time limitations may have affected their decision-making. During both seasons, juveniles had the lowest performance, sub-adults intermediate performance and adults the highest performance. Our results show age- and seasonal variation in time and energy-minimization strategies that are not necessarily exclusive of one another. Beyond time and energy, a complex suite of factors, including weather, experience and navigation ability, influences migratory performance and decision-making. © 2015 British Ornithologists’ Union},

abstract={Shifts in the distribution of benthivorous predators provide an indication of underlying environmental changes in benthic-mediated ecosystems. Spectacled Eiders (Somateria fischeri) are benthivorous sea ducks that spend the nonbreeding portion of their annual cycle in the Bering, Chukchi, Beaufort, and East Siberian seas. Sea ducks generally molt in biologically productive areas with abundant prey. If the distribution of eiders at molting areas matches prey abundance, spatial shifts may indicate changes in environmental conditions in the Arctic. We used a randomization procedure to test for shifts in the distribution of satellite telemetry locations received from Spectacled Eiders in the 1990s and 2008-2011 within 4 late-summer, ice-free molting areas: Indigirka-Kolyma, northern Russia; Ledyard Bay, eastern Chukchi Sea; Norton Sound, northeastern Bering Sea; and Mechigmenskiy Gulf, northwestern Bering Sea. We also tested for interannual and interdecadal changes in dive depth required to reach prey, which might affect the energetic costs of foraging during the molting period. Transmitter-marked birds used each molting area in each year, although the distribution of Spectacled Eiders shifted within each area. Interdecadal shifts in Ledyard Bay and Norton Sound decreased dive depth in recent years, although minor differences in depth were biologically negligible in relation to the energetic expense of feather growth. Shifts in Mechigmenskiy Gulf and Indigirka-Kolyma did not occur consistently within or among decades, which suggests greater interannual variability among environmental factors that influence distribution in these areas. Shifts in each molting area suggest dynamic ecosystem processes, with implications for Spectacled Eiders if changes result in novel competition or predation, or in shifting prey regimes. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Surprisingly little is known about the migration and stopover biology of Ruby-throated Hummingbirds (Archilochus colubris), and even less is known about their sex- or age-dependent migration. First, we provide basic information on the migration and stopover biology of this species along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico during autumn, including phenology, stopover duration, fuel deposition rate (FDR), arrival mass, and estimated flight ranges. Second, we investigate whether these stopover variables are influenced by age or sex. Age-dependent migration is expected because young, hatch-year birds on their first migration lack the experience of older individuals. Sex-dependent migration is expected because of sexually dimorphic characteristics in wing morphology and body size. We obtained information on arrival mass, phenology, FDR, stopover duration, and estimated flight ranges through banding data, passive integrated transponder tags, radio telemetry, and color marking at a long-term migration station along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Our data provide strong evidence for age-dependent migration and only weak evidence for sex-dependent migration. Older birds arrived earlier, had larger fuel loads, and had shorter stopover durations than younger birds. In younger birds, we found no effect of sex on FDR, arrival mass, stopover duration, or phenology. Older males arrived with larger fuel loads than females. Finally, we used flight simulation software and our data to estimate that males and older birds were capable of longer potential flight ranges than either females or younger birds. © 2016 American Ornithologists' Union.},

abstract={Forest succession affects species that rely on specific successional stages of forest development as core habitat. The spruce grouse (Falcipennis canadensis) is a mid-successional boreal forest obligate declining in population size and range extent in the northeastern United States. We evaluated habitat occupancy from 2002 to 2006 and we contrasted spruce grouse habitat use at multiple spatial scales to determine if advancing succession of boreal forest influenced the species' distribution in New York from 2002 to 2012. We detected grouse at less than half (n = 13) of forest patches occupied from 1976 to 1987 and at one previously undocumented patch suggesting in aggregate a 71% reduction in extent of area occupied. Spruce grouse kernel home ranges reflected a 13× greater selection for short (<6. m) lowland conifer over tall (>6. m) lowland conifer, a 4.5× greater selection of short lowland conifer over upland conifer, and an 8× greater selection for ericaceous vegetation over tall lowland conifer. Within home ranges, bird radiolocations revealed an 8.5× greater selection for short lowland conifer over upland conifer, a 6.6× greater selection of short lowland conifer over ericaceous vegetation, a 5× greater selection of tall lowland conifer over upland conifer, and a 4× greater selection of tall lowland conifer over ericaceous vegetation. Occupied forest patches were 75% closer to other occupied patches than were formerly occupied patches. Moreover occupied patches were 10% larger, they were characterized by 90% less Sphagnum spp., 5× greater ericaceous shrub cover, 34% greater tree density, 71% less live vegetation >6. m tall, 8% less coniferous shrub cover, and contained about half of the live vegetation from 4 to 6. m above the ground. Trees were 20% younger in occupied versus formerly occupied patches (x-= 43.37 [SE = 41.82-44.95] versus 51.87 [SE = 50.95-52.81], respectively). We also observed 17% greater importance value (i.e., IV = 100. ×. [relative basal area. ×. relative density. ×. relative frequency]/3) of tamarack (Larix laricina) and a 43% less balsam fir (Abies balsamea) importance value suggesting a decreased component of earlier successional species in occupied versus formerly occupied patches. We conclude that reduced size and greater isolation of remaining habitat patches as well as forest succession have contributed to spruce grouse declines in New York, processes that could be reversed through establishment of mid-successional forest patches near remaining grouse-occupied habitats. © 2015.},

abstract={It is unlikely all male sage-grouse are detected during lek counts, which could complicate the use of lek counts as an index to population abundance. Understanding factors that influence detection probabilities will allow managers to more accurately estimate the number of males present on leks. We fitted 410 males with global positioning system and very high frequency transmitters, and uniquely identifiable leg-bands over 4 years in Carbon County, Wyoming. We counted male sage-grouse using commonly used lek-count protocols and evaluated variables associated with our ability to detect marked males using sightability surveys on 22 leks. We evaluated detection probabilities of male sage-grouse based on factors related to bird characteristics such as age or posture, lek and group size, lek characteristics such as vegetation cover or aspect, light conditions, weather, and observer. We then applied the detection probabilities to more accurately estimate male counts on leks. Detection probabilities were generally high (x¯ = 0.87) but varied among leks from 0.77 to 0.93. Male sage-grouse detection declined with increasing sagebrush height and bare ground and increased with more snow cover. Detection probabilities were also lower when observers counted from a higher elevation than the lek. Our sightability models predicted detection well and can be used to accurately estimate male abundance on leks from lek counts, which is especially useful where accurate abundance estimates are required or inference about population status is based on only 1 count. Further, it is important to consider lek attendance as a component of counts on leks because it affects availability of male sage-grouse for detection during lek counts. Detection can be maximized by conducting lek counts from 30 minutes before sunrise to 30 minutes after sunrise, although current protocols recommend lek counts can be performed up to 1 hour after sunrise. Detection can also be maximized by conducting lek counts ≥2 days after snowfall, which maximizes attendance and detection. © 2015 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Woodland and forest degradation, driven predominately by agricultural and pastoral production, is a crisis facing many species globally, in particular hollow-dependent fauna. Large predatory species play important roles in both ecosystems and conservation strategies, but few studies have examined habitat selection of such species in intensively human-modified landscapes. We quantified habitat selection and resource use by a large, top-order and threatened snake (carpet python, Morelia spilota), between adjacent areas of high and low anthropogenic modification in inland Australia, a region that has undergone considerable alteration since European settlement. At the low-impact site, snakes preferred tree hollows and a structurally complex understorey, whereas at the high-impact site, snakes preferred homestead attics. Based on the decline of the species in this region, however, high-impact landscapes may only support snakes when they are adjacent to low-impact habitats. Invasive species comprised a large part of snake diets in both landscape types. Carpet pythons, with large home ranges and habitat requirements that overlap with many smaller threatened mammalian and avian fauna, are generally well liked and easily identifiable by rural landholders. Accordingly, they may play a key role in conservation strategies aimed at the protection of woodland and hollow-dependent fauna in heavily modified landscapes of Australia's inland regions. However, invasive species, which tend to contribute to declines in native species inhabiting arid and semi-arid Australia, are beneficial and important to pythons. Our study therefore highlights the diversity of effects that two major threats to biodiversity - habitat loss and invasive species - can have on different species within the same ecosystem. © 2016 Ecological Society of Australia.},

We examined whether displacement or attraction occurred 1 year after construction (immediate effect) and the average displacement or attraction 2-5 years after construction (delayed effect). We tested for these effects overall and within distance bands of 100, 200, 300, and >300 m from turbines. We observed displacement for 7 of 9 species. One species was unaffected by wind facilities and one species exhibited attraction. Displacement and attraction generally occurred within 100 m and often extended up to 300 m. In a few instances, displacement extended beyond 300 m. Displacement and attraction occurred 1 year after construction and persisted at least 5 years. Our research provides a framework for applying a BACI design to displacement studies and highlights the erroneous conclusions that can be made without the benefit of adopting such a design. More broadly, species-specific behaviors can be used to inform management decisions about turbine placement and the potential impact to individual species. Additionally, the avoidance distance metrics we estimated can facilitate future development of models evaluating impacts of wind facilities under differing land-use scenarios. © 2016, Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract={Some fruit-eating bird species commonly consume cultivated fruit. Species-specific variation in diet preferences could result in varying use of orchards and impacts on the fruit-producing industry. However, species-specific studies of avian orchard use are lacking, particularly throughout the fruit-growing season. Our objectives were to quantify the frequency of daily bird visits to orchards and the amount of time birds spent visiting orchards each day over the fruit-ripening season. Birds are well-documented consumers of cultivated sweet cherries (Prunus avium), which are relatively high in sugar and low in proteins and lipids. American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and Cedar Waxwings (Bombycilla cedrorum) are common fruit-consumers in sweet cherry orchards. Robins often consume larger proportions of invertebrates and prefer lipid-rich fruits, while waxwings choose sugary fruits. Given these species-specific diet differences, we hypothesized waxwings would spend a greater proportion of days and more time each day in cherry orchards, compared to robins. We used radio telemetry to track the habitat use of 25 American Robins and 17 Cedar Waxwings in sweet cherry orchards of Michigan. Over their respective radio-tracking periods, waxwings visited orchards a greater percentage of days than robins (waxwings: mean = 21%, SD = 22; robins: mean = 6%, SD = 4). In addition, waxwings visited orchards for more time each day. Differences in diet preferences and nutritional physiology may translate into species-specific patterns of habitat use for birds in fruit-rich environments. © 2016 The Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Nest boxes for American Kestrels Falco sparverius may alleviate local nest site limitation, but there is concern that periodically opening nest boxes or handling adults may negatively affect nesting success. I monitored 536 kestrel breeding attempts ≥1 egg laid in about 100 nest boxes in northwestern New Jersey, 1995-2012. To study return rates, I opportunistically captured adults in nest boxes and marked them with U.S.G.S. leg bands and patagial tags. To examine possible effects of this disturbance, I compared nesting success ≥1 nestling surviving to banding age of marked and unmarked adults. Nesting success was 67% for 270 unmarked pairs, 76% for 25 pairs with only the male marked, 82% for 206 pairs with only the female marked, and 91% for 35 pairs with both adults marked. This significant difference likely reflects differences in the probability of capture: successful attempts last longer and successful parents may be more attentive. To control for these correlations, I examined attempts for which the first disturbance was encountering an adult in the nest box; that bird either flushed from the nest box or was captured and marked. Abandonment was not significantly related to this initial disturbance: breeding attempts continued for 94.3% of attempts in which the male flushed, 93.1% for males handled, 93.7% for females flushed, and 93.2% for females handled. Nesting success also did not differ significantly among these four treatment groups. The timing of the first disturbance did not significantly affect abandonment; breeding attempts continued for 90% of attempts in which males were first disturbed flushed or handled during the laying period, 94% for males during incubation, 97% for females during laying, and 93% for females during incubation. Nesting success also was not significantly related to timing of the initial disturbance. Thus, it appears that both the intensity handling or not and timing of disturbance had no substantial effect on abandonment or nesting success for this population. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

Little is known about their foraging behavior and patterns of habitat use during this flightless period. We used radio transmitters to track male Long-tailed Ducks through the molt period from 2000 to 2002 in three lagoons: one adjacent to industrial oil field development and activity and two in areas without industrial activity. We found that an index to time spent foraging generally increased through the molt period. Foraging, habitat use, and home range size showed similar patterns, but those patterns were highly variable among lagoons and across years. Even with continuous daylight during the study period, birds tended to use offshore areas during the day for feeding and roosted in protected nearshore waters at night. We suspect that variability in behaviors associated with foraging, habitat use, and home range size are likely influenced by availability of invertebrate prey.

abstract={Information on the foraging ecology of animals is important for conservation and management, particularly for keystone species whose presence affects ecosystem health. We examined foraging by an at-risk cavity excavator, the white-headed woodpecker (Picoides albolarvatus). The foraging needs of this species are used to inform management of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in some areas of western North America. Past observational studies indicated that white-headed woodpeckers forage predominately on cones and trunks of large-diameter (&gt;68cm) pines in old-growth stands, although habitat selection while foraging has not been formally examined. We used radio telemetry to track forage substrate use among 37 adult, breeding woodpeckers for 176h (10,576min) in forest stands that had been recently thinned and/or burned with prescribed fire. We used discrete choice models to examine forage site selection and multinomial regression to examine consequences of foraging on nest productivity. Woodpeckers foraged on more than ten individual substrates and switched substrates seasonally, presumably to take advantage of prey availability. Dead wood and fir foliage were used commonly in the nesting period (86% and 68% of foraging, respectively), whereas pine foliage and trunk foraging dominated in the fledgling (66% of foraging) and post-fledgling periods (73% of foraging). Average size of used trees was 49cm (±20cm) and pine cones were rarely used (4% of foraging). During the nesting period, substrate use (χ2=1.49, df=4, P=0.83) and distances traveled from nests for foraging did not affect productivity (F(3,16)=0.61, P=0.62), which was high even for birds with the longest (2.1km) and shortest (0.39km) maximum forage distances. Habitats selected for foraging matched substrate use, and woodpeckers selected areas with low basal areas of live trees in the nesting period, but high basal areas in the post-nesting period. The variable foraging that we observed suggests that white-headed woodpeckers are plastic in their foraging in managed forests, and this plasticity has no negative consequences for productivity. © 2015.},

abstract={We tested whether captive breeding and release is a feasible restoration strategy for the Harpy Eagle Harpia harpyja where suitable unoccupied habitat remains within its former range. From 1987 through 2006, 18 Harpy Eagles participated in a captive breeding program started in Boise, Idaho, and continued in Panama from 2001. From 131 eggs laid, 44 eagles were fledged. Most young were produced by just three females in the program, and at a higher annual rate after the birds were moved from Boise to Panama. Re-laying induced by collecting eggs for artificial incubation increased the number of viable eggs laid per female each breeding season up to six, but may have reduced female reproductive lifetime. Including rehabilitated eagles hatched in the wild, we released 49 eagles from 1998 through 2009. When the last released eagle with a functioning radio transmitter died in 2011, 63% were known or presumed to be dead, 31% were missing and possibly alive, and 6% were back in captivity. Shooting 44% was the primary cause of death. Behavior interpreted as aggression toward humans was sufficiently frequent 23% of released eagles in captive-raised and wild-rehabilitated eagles after release to be a concern for public safety and a potential cause of shooting deaths. This study demonstrated that it is feasible to breed Harpy Eagles in captivity at high rates needed for species restoration. It is possible to release captive-reared and rehabilitated Harpy Eagles to the wild, and is most cost effective i.e., resulting in the highest survival to hunting-independence when eagles are released close to the age of independence. Preventing shooting and other kinds of human persecution, and protecting remaining forest habitat, are the most urgent conservation needs for the Harpy Eagle. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

Wintering locations were in Mexico and ranged from the southern Mexican state of Chiapas north to Sonora and Chihuahua.

abstract={Most of the known wintering areas of Piping Plovers (Charadrius melodus) are along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States and into Mexico, and in the Caribbean. However, 1066 threatened/endangered Piping Plovers were recently found wintering in The Bahamas, an area not previously known to be important for the species. Although representing about 27% of the birds counted during the 2011 International Piping Plover Winter Census, the location of their breeding site(s) was unknown. Thus, our objectives were to determine the location(s) of their breeding site(s) using molecular markers and by tracking banded individuals, identify spring and fall staging sites, and examine site fidelity and survival. We captured and color-banded 57 birds in January and February 2010 in The Bahamas. Blood samples were also collected for genetic evaluation of the likely subspecies wintering in The Bahamas. Band re-sightings and DNA analysis revealed that at least 95% of the Piping Plovers wintering in The Bahamas originated on the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada. Re-sightings of birds banded in The Bahamas spanned the breeding distribution of the species along the Atlantic coast from Newfoundland to North Carolina. Site fidelity to breeding and wintering sites was high (88-100%). Spring and fall staging sites were located along the Atlantic coast of the United States, with marked birds concentrating in the Carolinas. Our estimate of true survival for the marked birds was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.61-0.80). Our results indicate that more than one third of the Piping Plover population that breeds along the Atlantic coast winters in The Bahamas. By determining the importance of The Bahamas to the Atlantic subspecies of Piping Plovers, future conservation efforts for these populations can be better focused on where they are most needed. © 2016 Association of Field Ornithologists.},

abstract={Avian nest success often varies seasonally and because predation is the primary cause of nest failure, seasonal variation in predator activity has been hypothesized to explain seasonal variation in nest success. Despite the fact that nest predator communities are often diverse, recent evidence from studies of snakes that are nest predators has lent some support to the link between snake activity and nest predation. However, the strength of the relationship has varied among studies. Explaining this variation is difficult, because none of these studies directly identified nest predators, the link between predator activity and nest survival was inferred. To address this knowledge gap, we examined seasonal variation in daily survival rates of 463 bird nests (of 17 bird species) and used cameras to document predator identity at 137 nests. We simultaneously quantified seasonal activity patterns of two local snake species (N = 30 individuals) using manual (2136 snake locations) and automated (89,165 movements detected) radiotelemetry. Rat snakes (Pantherophis obsoletus), the dominant snake predator at the site (~28% of observed nest predations), were most active in late May and early June, a pattern reported elsewhere for this species. When analyzing all monitored nests, we found no link between nest predation and seasonal activity of rat snakes. When analyzing only nests with known predator identities (filmed nests), however, we found that rat snakes were more likely to prey on nests during periods when they were moving the greatest distances. Similarly, analyses of all monitored nests indicated that nest survival was not linked to racer activity patterns, but racer-specific predation (N = 17 nests) of filmed nests was higher when racers were moving the greatest distances. Our results suggest that the activity of predators may be associated with higher predation rates by those predators, but that those effects can be difficult to detect when nest predator communities are diverse and predator identities are not known. Additionally, our results suggest that hand-tracking of snakes provides a reliable indicator of predator activity that may be more indicative of foraging behavior than movement frequency provided by automated telemetry systems. © 2016 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

abstract={Migratory behavior of waterfowl populations in North America has traditionally been broadly characterized by four north-south flyways, and these flyways have been central to the management of waterfowl populations for more than 80 yr. However, previous flyway characterizations are not easily updated with current bird movement data and fail to provide assessments of the importance of specific geographical regions to the identification of flyways. Here, we developed a network model of migratory movement for four waterfowl species, Mallard (Anas platyrhnchos), Northern Pintail (A. acuta), American Green-winged Teal (A. carolinensis), and Canada Goose (Branta canadensis), in North America, using bird band and recovery data. We then identified migratory flyways using a community detection algorithm and characterized the importance of smaller geographic regions in identifying flyways using a novel metric, the consolidation factor. We identified four main flyways for Mallards, Northern Pintails, and American Green-winged Teal, with the flyway identification in Canada Geese exhibiting higher complexity. For Mallards, flyways were relatively consistent through time. However, consolidation factors revealed that for Mallards and Green-winged Teal, the presumptive Mississippi flyway was potentially a zone of high mixing between other flyways. Our results demonstrate that the network approach provides a robust method for flyway identification that is widely applicable given the relatively minimal data requirements and is easily updated with future movement data to reflect changes in flyway definitions and management goals. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract={Variation in regional population trends for mallards breeding in the western United States indicates that additional research into factors that influence demographics could contribute to management and understanding the population demographics of mallards across North America. We estimated breeding incidence and adult female, nest, and brood survival in eastern Washington in 2006 and 2007 by monitoring female mallards with radio telemetry and tested how those parameters were influenced by study year (2006 vs. 2007), landscape type (agricultural vs. natural), and age (second year [SY] vs. after second year [ASY]). We also investigated the effects of female body condition and capture date on breeding incidence, and nest initiation date and hatch date on nest and brood survival, respectively. We included population parameters in a stage-based demographic model and conducted a perturbation analysis to identify which vital rates were most influential on population growth rate (λ). Adult female survival was best modeled with a constant weekly survival rate (0.994, SE = 0.003). Breeding incidence differed between years and was higher for birds in better body condition. Nest survival was higher for ASY females (0.276, SE = 0.118) than SY females (0.066, SE = 0.052), and higher on publicly managed lands (0.383, SE = 0.212) than agricultural (0.114, SE = 0.058) landscapes. Brood survival was best modeled with a constant rate for the 7-week monitoring period (0.50, SE = 0.155). The single variable having the greatest influence on λ was non-breeding season survival, but the combination of parameters from the breeding grounds explained a greater percent of the variance in λ. Mallard population growth rate was most sensitive to changes in non-breeding survival, nest success, brood survival, and breeding incidence. Future management decisions should focus on activities that improve these vital rates if managers want to increase the production of mallards in eastern Washington. © 2016 The Wildlife Society.},

abstract={Researchers have long recognized that the spatial distribution of animals relates to habitat requirements. In birds, despite recent advances in tracking techniques, knowledge of habitat needs remains incomplete for most species. Using radio telemetry, we quantified the relative space use of 37 Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) males, captured over 2 years (2013, 2014) on their breeding grounds in coastal Virginia. Following tracking, we collected data on prey availability (n = 370 plots) and habitat structure (n = 222 plots) within bird home ranges, and modeled bird utilization distribution with both sets of variables using mixed models. Our objectives were to (a) determine the relative importance of habitat structure and prey availability for bird use, (b) identify specific resources that related to bird utilization distribution, (c) test the hypothesis that soil moisture explained prey availability, and (d) evaluate models by determining whether model-identified conditions agreed with data at sites where Wood Thrushes were absent over the preceding 5 years. Of prey variables, high-use areas within bird home ranges were linked to higher biomass of spiders and worm-like invertebrates, which were strongly correlated with soil moisture. Of habitat structure variables, bird use related negatively to red oak (Quercus spp.) count and pine (Pinus spp.) basal area, and positively to forest canopy height, snag basal area, and number and species richness of trees, among others. Evaluation of 12 covariates in our best model revealed that 5 were significant, with conditions at bird absence sites congruent with our models. Goodness-of-fit tests revealed poor fit of the prey-only model, whereas the habitat-only model explained nearly 8 times the variation in bird use. The model utilizing both prey and structure covariates yielded only marginal improvement over the habitat-only model. Consequently, management objectives aimed at habitat improvement for the declining Wood Thrush should particularly consider habitat structure resources. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Gulls (Larus spp.) commonly roost in large numbers on inland and coastal waters, yet there is little information on how or where gulls choose sites for roosting. Roost site selection can lead to water quality degradation or aviation hazards when roosts are formed on water supply reservoirs or are close to airports. Harassment programs are frequently initiated to move or relocate roosting gulls but often have mixed results because gulls are reluctant to leave or keep returning. As such, knowledge of gull roost site selection and roosting ecology has applied and ecological importance. We used satellite telemetry and an information-theoretic approach to model seasonal roost selection of ring-billed (L. delawarensis) and herring gulls (L. argentatus) in Massachusetts, USA. Our results indicated that ring-billed gulls preferred freshwater roosts and will use a variety of rivers, lakes, and reservoirs. Herring gulls regularly roosted on fresh water but used salt water roosts more often than ring-billed gulls and also roosted on a variety of land habitats. Roost modeling showed that herring and ring-billed gulls selected inland fresh water roosts based on size of the water body and proximity to their last daytime location; they selected the largest roost closest to where they ended the day. Management strategies to reduce or eliminate roosting gulls could identify and try to eliminate other habitat variables (e.g., close-by foraging sites) that are attracting gulls before attempting to relocate or redistribute (e.g., through hazing programs) roosting birds. © The Wildlife Society, 2016.},

abstract={Bank Swallows (Riparia riparia) congregate in large nocturnal roosts during the non-breeding season. Scant evidence suggests that Bank Swallows may also congregate regularly in nocturnal roosts during the breeding period. To help clarify the issue, we used automated radio-telemetry to document the roosting behavior of 11 males and 11 females that were tending nests with young at two nesting colonies. Nineteen of the 22 birds (86%) spent at least one night roosting away from the colony, and 13 of the 22 birds (59%) spent at least one night roosting likely within a large marsh located ∼30 km away from the colonies. Females tended to roost overnight at the colony more than males. The proportion of nights birds spent roosting away from the colony was highly variable between individuals. Minimum flight speeds to an evening roost site (∼30 km distant) were significantly greater than return flights back to the colony in the morning. Our study confirms that breeding Bank Swallows do in fact regularly roost away from the colony during the nestling period. Our study also highlights some new and intriguing questions regarding how Bank Swallows use the landscape during the breeding season, and the potential importance of wetland roost sites in the proximity of breeding colonies. © 2016 The Wilson Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Marbled Murrelets (Brachyramphus marmoratus) are listed as threatened in the portion of their range extending from British Columbia to California due to loss of nesting habitat. Recovery of Marbled Murrelet populations requires a better understanding of the characteristics of their nesting habitat in this part of their range. Our objective, therefore, was to describe their nesting habitat in Washington State and Vancouver Island, British Columbia. We captured Marbled Murrelets from 2004 to 2008, fitted them with radio transmitters, and followed them to nests (N = 20). We used Cohen's unbiased d effect size to assess differences between forest plots surrounding nest sites and nearby control sites (N = 18). Nest sites had less canopy cover of the dominant conifers and fewer, but larger, trees than control sites. Nest sites also had greater percentages of trees with platforms >10 cm diameter and >15 cm diameter, and more platforms of these sizes than control sites. The mean diameter at breast height of nest trees was 136.5 cm (range = 84–248 cm) and all but one nest was in dominant or co-dominant tree species. At the landscape scale, we used vegetation maps derived from remotely sensed data and found greater canopy cover, higher density of mature trees, more platforms >10 cm/ha, and more old-growth habitat at nest sites than at random sites. Our findings suggest that, at the site scale, nesting Marbled Murrelets selected the most suitable features of forest structure across expansive potentially suitable habitat. Our landscape-scale analysis showed that habitat features in nesting stands differed from those features in available stands in the murrelet's range in Washington. We also found that stands with nests were less fragmented than available forest across murrelet range. All nest sites of radio-tagged birds in Washington were in protected areas in mostly undisturbed forest habitat. Conservation of these areas of inland nesting habitat will be critical to the recovery of Marbled Murrelet populations. Published 2016.

abstract={Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) is considered an umbrella species for sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) landscapes in western North America. In 2015, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service determined sage-grouse unwarranted for protection under the Endangered Species Act (1973) because of conservation actions in priority areas. Understanding seasonal movements is key to delineation and assessment of priority conservation areas. We monitored radiomarked sage-grouse from 1998 to 2013 throughout Utah, USA, to determine seasonal movements. Maximum distances from nearest lek to nesting, summer, and winter locations across all radiomarked grouse averaged 2.20 km (90th percentile = 5.06 km), 3.93 km (90th percentile = 8.45 km), and 3.76 km (90th percentile = 7.15 km), respectively. Maximum movements from nest to summer, nest to winter, and between summer and winter locations across all radiomarked grouse averaged 5.77 km (90th percentile = 13.60 km), 11.77 km (90th percentile = 26.36 km), and 14.75 km (90th percentile = 30.77 km), respectively. Maximum distance from lek of capture to summer locations was greater for males than females, whereas females moved farther than males from lek to winter and summer to winter locations. Adult females moved farther than yearlings from lek to nest and summer to winter areas. The state of Utah's Sage-Grouse Management Areas included approximately 85% of the radiotelemetry seasonal locations and >95% when weighted by lek counts.

abstract={Common raven (Corvus corax) populations have increased several-fold in the western United States during the past century; these birds cause problems when they kill new-borne lambs and calves and depredate nests of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). The toxicant DRC-1339 is used by U.S. Department of Agriculture/Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service Wildlife Services to manage common raven populations and reduce the severity of these problems, but it is difficult to determine how many ravens are killed by an application because carcasses are rarely found. We examined the effectiveness of DRC-1339 applications for preventative control of ravens at 3 landfills and 5 nearby roosts in Wyoming, USA, from 2013 through 2015. Wildlife Services removed 23%, 34%, and 7% of the radiomarked sample of ravens in southwestern Wyoming during 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively, according to Kaplan–Meier survival estimates. During the 3 winters, 235 of 240 raven carcasses that we collected died from DRC-1339 poisoning. The following year, raven fecundity and immigration had offset most, but not all, of the mortality produced by the DRC-1339 program. Raven population estimates declined 9% from the 2013 winter to the 2014 winter and 12% from the 2014 winter to the 2015 winter, based on telemetry data and roost counts. Ravens did not avoid landfills after they were treated with DRC-1339 probably because few ravens died there. Estimated mortality rates from DRC-1339 applications based on carcass counts underestimated the actual rates by 79% and landfill counts of ravens underestimated it by 49%.

abstract={Captive-rearing and release programs have been used to augment populations of ring-necked pheasant (Phasianus colchicus), northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), and other gamebirds to provide additional hunting opportunities. However, many question the efficacy of the rear-and-release technique to increase huntable gamebird populations. The Surrogator® (hereafter, surrogator) is a captive-rearing system purported to establish huntable gamebird populations within a property. Little research has been conducted to inform land managers and sportsmen and sportswomen about the effectiveness of this system. We evaluated the use of the surrogator for ring-necked pheasants and northern bobwhites from May to October 2009 and 2010 in Kiowa County, Kansas, USA. The 4-week in-surrogator survival rates for pheasant chicks were 85% ± 5% (SE) in 2009 (n = 840) and 79% ± 8% in 2010 (n = 420). The 5-week in-surrogator survival of bobwhite chicks was 78% ± 12% (n = 765) in 2009 and 79% ± 3% in 2010 (n = 783). Released pheasant chicks had an overall survival rate of 8% ± 6% (n = 58) over 12 weeks. Eight-week postrelease survival for bobwhites was 35% ± 5% (n = 59). Postrelease survival of pheasants or bobwhites was not appreciably greater than conventional rear-and-release programs, suggesting that population establishment with surrogator birds may be difficult. Although 1,150 pheasants and 1,105 bobwhites were released, only 5.5% and 7.2% of bands were returned from harvested pheasants and bobwhites, respectively. The surrogator may not be effective for establishing or re-establishing pheasant and bobwhite populations, but it may be an effective tool to supplement existing gamebird populations to enhance hunting opportunities. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016},

abstract={We examined encounter records from 1925 to 2015 for Red-tailed Hawks banded in the northeastern U.S.A. (n = 1002) and characterized movement patterns by evaluating straight-line distances, difference in latitude, and directionality between banding and encounter locations. We define "encounter" as any handling of a live banded bird, any recovery (a banded bird found dead), and any resighting (reading and reporting a band number on a live bird without actually handling the bird). The mean direction of all hawk encounters was to the southwest of banding locations but some hawks ranged widely; encounters occurred in 27 states, including some in the Mississippi flyway, and in four Canadian provinces. Hawks banded as nestlings or as hatch-year birds (younger) were encountered at farther distances and across a wider range of latitudes than hawks banded as after-hatch-year (AHY) or after-second-year (ASY; older). Most encounters were of younger hawks. In mid-century, most known mortalities were due to shooting; more recent mortalities were due to collisions with vehicles, buildings, or other objects. Some young hawks apparently dispersed out of their natal areas or began migration by three mo post-fledging, and hawks hatched in the Northeast apparently do not migrate north during their first summer. Hawks banded at higher latitudes were encountered at locations farther south than hawks banded at lower latitudes, substantiating leapfrog migration in this species. Encounter data suggested philopatric tendencies; hawks banded as nestlings and encountered at >46 mo of age were encountered significantly closer to their natal areas than hawks banded as nestlings and encountered <46 mo after banding, and more than 10% of hawks banded as ASY or AHY were encountered after several years in the same 10-minute block in which they were banded. Hawks banded as nestlings and encountered at age >46 mo and >250 km from their natal area were considered long-distance dispersers. Between 1930 and 2010, for all hawks banded during the breeding season or summer and encountered in autumn or winter, the difference between banding latitude and encounter latitude decreased by about 4°, suggesting migratory short-stopping. © 2016 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Avian trichomonosis, a disease typically caused by the protozoan parasite Trichomonas gallinae, is a well recognized cause of death in many avian species. In California, US, trichomonosis has caused periodic epidemics in Pacific Coast Band-tailed Pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata monilis). We summarize reported mortality events and investigate ecologic drivers and population impacts associated with epidemic mortality due to trichomonosis in Band-tailed Pigeons. Between 1945 and 2014, 59 mortality events involving Band-tailed Pigeons were reported in California with the number of reported events increasing over time. Estimated mortality for these events was variable, ranging between 10 and 10,000 pigeons. Events were most-frequently reported in Monterey (19%; 11/59) and San Luis Obispo (8%; 5/59) counties. Events often started in January (32%; 9/28) and February (50%; 14/28) and lasted 5–68 d. Impacts of mortality events on pigeon populations were indicated by Breeding Bird Survey and Christmas Bird Count abundance indices, which showed a decline in outbreak years compared to nonoutbreak years. Environmental conditions most associated with outbreak years included higher average temperatures between January and March, the period most associated with mortality events, and lower average precipitation in December just prior to mortality events. In Monterey County, events tended to occur in winters following higher acorn production of coast live oaks (Quercus agrifolia) in the fall. Weather and food abundance could be related to increased transmission or enhanced viability of Trichomonas spp. Although estimated mortality due to avian trichomonosis was highly variable across years, cumulative losses were substantial and likely to have a negative impact on population size. © Wildlife Disease Association 2016.},

abstract={Nest attendance behavior is a critical component of avian ecology that influences nest survival and population productivity. Birds that provide uniparental care during incubation and brood-rearing must balance the benefit of reproductive success with the costs of physiological needs and predation risk. We used miniature nest cameras to record 5904 h of video footage at 33 nests of Greater Prairie-Chickens (Tympanuchus cupido) during 2010 and 2011 in northcentral Kansas. We quantified the timing and duration of incubation bouts to address alternative hypotheses about physiological requirements and predation risk as drivers of incubation behavior. We also identified nest predators and determined timing of predation events, and tested for effects of nest attendance and monitoring technique on nest survival (video vs. telemetry). Female prairie chickens exhibited high incubation constancy per day (~95 %) and typically took two ~40-min recesses per day: one after sunrise and one before sunset. Mesocarnivores were responsible for 75 % (18 of 24) of nest losses, and most nest predation events occurred during crepuscular or overnight hours. Controlled comparisons provided no evidence that video surveillance attracted predators to nests. Variation in nest attendance had a minimal effect on nest survival compared to height of vegetative cover at the nest site. Timing of recesses did not indicate avoidance of predator activity in our study system. The bimodal pattern of incubation breaks observed in most grouse species is likely driven by physiological requirements of the female rather than predation pressure. Female Greater Prairie-Chickens appear to prioritize their metabolic needs and future reproductive potential over current nest survival. © 2016, Dt. Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.},

abstract={Implanted biologging devices, such as satellite-linked platform transmitter terminals (PTTs), have been used widely to delineate populations and identify movement patterns of sea ducks. Although in some cases these ecological studies could reveal transmitter effects on behavior and mortality, experiments conducted under controlled conditions can provide valuable information to understand the influence of implanted tags on health and physiology. We report the clinical, mass, biochemical, and histological responses of captive Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima) implanted with PTTs with percutaneous antennas. We trained 6 individuals to dive 4.9 m for their food, allowed them to acclimate to this dive depth, and implanted them with PTTs. We collected data before surgery to establish baselines, and for 3.5 mo after surgery. The first feeding dive took place 22 hr after surgery, with 5 of 6 birds diving to the bottom within 35 hr of surgery. Plumage waterproofing around surgical sites was reduced ≤21 days after surgery. Mass; albumin; albumin:globulin ratio; aspartate aminotransferase; β1-, β2-, and γ-globulins; creatine kinase; fecal glucocorticoid metabolites; heterophil:lymphocyte ratio; and packed cell volume changed from baseline on one or more of the postsurgery sampling dates, and some changes were still evident 3.5 mo after surgery. Our findings show that Common Eiders physiologically responded for up to 3.5 mo after surgical implantation of a PTT, with the greatest response occurring within the first few weeks of implantation. These responses support the need for postsurgery censor periods for satellite telemetry data and should be considered when designing studies and analyzing information from PTTs in sea ducks. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

abstract={We can improve our ability to assess population viability and forecast population growth under different scenarios by understanding factors that limit population parameters in each stage of the annual cycle. Postfledging mortality rates may be as variable as nest survival across regions and fragmentation gradients, although factors that negatively impact nest survival may affect postfledging individuals in different ways. We examined nest and postfledging survival of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Acadian Flycatchers (Empidonax virescens) in mature forest fragments in central Missouri. We used an information-theoretic approach to determine support for effects of factors intrinsic to the individual or nest site, temporal factors, local vegetation characteristics, and distance to edge on survival in both stages. We also examined the effect of incorporating the resulting survival estimates on population growth. In both species, survival increased from nest to postfledging stages (Ovenbirds: 0.27 ± 0.06 to 0.50 ± 0.09; Acadian Flycatcher 0.30 ± 0.03 to 0.89 ± 0.11). Age was by far the best predictor of survival in postfledging birds, with the majority of mortalities occurring in the first week out of the nest. We did not find support for survival tradeoffs of habitat used by nesting or postfledging birds. Acadian Flycatcher nest and postfledging survival were both related to variables associated with mature forest. Ovenbird nest survival was most affected by habitat characteristics associated with core mature forest, although postfledging survival may have improved near non-forest edges. We replaced an arbitrary estimate of juvenile survival (half of adult survival) with an estimate incorporating empirical postfledging survival estimates. With these revised parameters, Acadian Flycatcher population growth was more affected (13-26% increase in lambda) than Ovenbird population growth (3-6% change). Our results illustrate that species occupying similar nesting habitat do not necessarily face the same risks during the postfledging period. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.},

Historically, limited ground-based counts of Red Knots on the Copper and Yukon- Kuskokwim river deltas in Alaska suggested these two regions were major stopover areas during spring migration. To further document connectivity, occurrence, local movements, and length of stay, we attached VHF transmitters to 70 adult Red Knots at Grays Harbor, Washington, and conducted aerial telemetry surveys at the Copper and Yukon-Kuskokwim river deltas. We relocated 84% and 70% of the marked birds at the Copper and Yukon-Kuskokwim river deltas, respectively, signifying a high level of connectivity between Grays Harbor and the two Alaska sites during spring migration. We identified areas previously not known to be important for Red Knots, including Controller Bay on the Copper River Delta and the southern coast of the Yukon-Kuskokwim River Delta. Short length of stay suggests that both study areas function primarily as stopover areas. © 2016, International Wader Study Group. All rights reserved.},

I investigated a possible limitation for a cooperatively breeding wren living in lowland tropical rainforest. I found that the composition of epiphytic foraging substrates, especially the abundance of bromeliads, correlated with the distribution of wren habitation, and were heavily foraged upon. High densities of these bromeliads were found only in gallery forests, suggesting that areas of high bromeliad density may be a limiting factor in dispersal in Band-backed Wrens (Campylorhynchus zonatus).},

abstract={Band recoveries from hunted populations are widely used to estimate survival and harvest rates. We used long-term (1950–2010) band-recovery data from the United States and Canada to estimate average survival and recovery rates for juvenile and adult sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), American coots (Fulica americana), clapper rails (Rallus longirostris), and Wilson's snipe (Gallinago delicata). Banding data were typically sparse and Brownie recovery rates (f) were <1% for most species and age classes, so we also utilized encounters from birds banded and recovered throughout the year, including nonhunting recoveries. Estimated juvenile and adult annual survival rates based on combined dead recoveries were 0.917 (SE = 0.080) and 0.884 (SE = 0.006) for sandhill cranes; 0.325 (SE = 0.025) and 0.583 (SE = 0.008) for American coots; 0.368 (SE = 0.070) and 0.500 (SE = 0.025) for clapper rails; and 0.372 (SE = 0.077) and 0.653 (SE = 0.020) for Wilson's snipe. American coots had sufficient band-recovery data during 1951–1987 to estimate annual process variation in survival for juveniles ((Formula presented.) = 0.017) and adults ((Formula presented.) = 0.056). Based on average estimated juvenile and adult survival rates for each species, stable populations could be achieved with average annual recruitment rates (expressed as fledged young per adult in the preseason population) of 0.15 (SD = 0.02) for sandhill cranes, 1.26 (SD = 0.19) for American coots, 1.41 (SD = 0.31) for clapper rails, and 0.97 (SD = 0.23) for Wilson's snipe, with uncertainty reflecting measurement error in survival rates. Although band-recovery models can be successfully applied to small data sets (e.g., 300–3,000 total recoveries in our analyses), juvenile survival estimates lacked precision and annual variation was inestimable for most species, leading to considerable uncertainty for population modeling efforts. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016},

Water depth at nests was shallow (< 15 cm), and nest sites were in locations with more visual obstruction, more microtopographic variation, and more woody stems, while open water cover was less than at random sites. Nine broods were followed and were found to use rearing sites that were in deeper water and had a greater percent of tall emergent vegetation and more woody vegetation than random sites. Brood size dropped from an average of nine to two chicks by the second week. Weekly brood survival rate was 0.87 (SE = 0.045), which resulted in a 29% probability of greater than one chick surviving to fledge at 9 weeks.

abstract={The tricolored blackbird (Agelaius tricolor, hereafter, tricolor) has experienced population declines and is currently under review for listing under both the California and Federal endangered species acts. Tricolors form the largest breeding colonies of any extant North American land bird, and are mostly found within the California Central Valley. However, smaller numbers of tricolors breed in other parts of lowland California, including the California Central Coast where the species is little-studied. From 2012 to 2014, we studied radio-tagged tricolors at four breeding colonies in Monterey County. The relative cover of the tricolors' primary grassland foraging habitat within 5 km of colony sites was lower than reported elsewhere. Birds arrived at colony sites from early-April to mid-May and remained up to 90 days. Nest-building occurred between 5 April and 18 June, with asynchronous nest-building at individual colonies occurring over periods up to 35 days. The largest colonies each year ranged from 600 to 800 birds. Twenty-five percent of radio-tagged birds moved between the study colonies during the breeding season, suggesting itinerant breeding. After breeding, 15% of tagged birds were observed near colony sites while 21% dispersed up to 37 km north and northeast towards known over-wintering areas (northern San Joaquin Valley, San Francisco Bay-Delta, and coastal Marin County). We also recorded, apparently for the first time, 1) arboreal foraging in oak woodlands, 2) use of lichen (Ramalina or Usnea spp.) as nest material, and 3) likely predation by long-tailed weasels (Mustela frenata). Given the observed variability in nesting chronology, our findings suggest that surveys of prospective breeding colonies should occur throughout the entire breeding season to accurately assess presence or absence of nesting tricolors. Additionally, inter-colony movements of tricolors suggest that continued use of any one location may depend upon the suitability and productivity of nearby colonies. Management regimes for the species must therefore ensure cooperation among multiple landmanagement entities controlling nearby tricolor habitats.},

abstract={Frequent prescribed fire (≤3 yr) and selective harvest of off-site hardwoods are the primary restoration and management tools for pine (Pinus spp.) savannas in the southeastern United States. However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) habitat selection in longleaf pine savannas and research is warranted to direct our future management decisions. Therefore, we investigated habitat selection of female turkeys in 2 longleaf pine savanna systems managed by frequent fire in southwestern Georgia during 2011–2013. We observed differential habitat selection across 2 scales (study area and seasonal area of use) and 3 seasons (fall-winter: 1 Oct–30 Jan; pre-breeding: 1 Feb–19 Apr; and summer: 16 Jun–30 Sep). During fall-winter, turkeys selected mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, and young pine stands, albeit at different scales. During pre-breeding, turkeys selected for mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, young pine, and shrub-scrub, although at different scales. During summer, turkeys also demonstrated scale-specific selection but generally selected for mature pine, hardwoods, and shrub-scrub. Days-since-fire did not influence selection of stands managed by frequent fire (≤3 yr). In cases where female turkeys used pine-dominated stands (i.e., mature pine, young pine, and mixed pine-hardwoods), selection was not influenced by days-since-fire; however, these results are at least partially due to a lack of longer burn rotations (>3 yr) on our study areas. We suggest land managers consider scale of selection by turkeys when developing habitat management strategies. In addition to creating early successional habitat conditions by using prescribed fire, we recommend managers retain hardwoods and recognize the importance of shrub-scrub cover to management of turkey populations in longleaf pine savannas. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016},

abstract={Previous efforts to relate winter-ground precipitation to subsequent reproductive success as measured by the ratio of juveniles to adults in the autumn failed to account for increased vulnerability of juvenile ducks to hunting and uncertainty in the estimated age ratio. Neglecting increased juvenile vulnerability will positively bias the mean productivity estimate, and neglecting increased vulnerability and estimation uncertainty will positively bias the year-to-year variance in productivity because raw age ratios are the product of sampling variation, the year-specific vulnerability, and year-specific reproductive success. Therefore, we estimated the effects of cumulative winter precipitation in the California Central Valley and the Mississippi Alluvial Valley on pintail (Anas acuta) and mallard (Anas platyrhnchos) reproduction, respectively, using hierarchical Bayesian methods to correct for sampling bias in productivity estimates and observation error in covariates. We applied the model to a hunter-collected parts survey implemented by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service and band recoveries reported to the United States Geological Survey Bird Banding Laboratory using data from 1961 to 2013. We compared our results to previous estimates that used simple linear regression on uncorrected age ratios from a smaller subset of years in pintail (1961–1985). Like previous analyses, we found large and consistent effects of population size and wetland conditions in prairie Canada on mallard productivity, and large effects of population size and mean latitude of the observed breeding population on pintail productivity. Unlike previous analyses, we report a large amount of uncertainty in the estimated effects of wintering-ground precipitation on pintail and mallard productivity, with considerable uncertainty in the sign of the estimated main effect, although the posterior medians of precipitation effects were consistent with past studies. We found more consistent estimates in the sign of an interaction effect between population size and precipitation, suggesting that wintering-ground precipitation has a larger effect in years of high population size, especially for pintail. When we used the estimated effects in a population model to derive a sustainable harvest and population size projection (i.e., a yield curve), there was considerable uncertainty in the effect of increased or decreased wintering-ground precipitation on sustainable harvest potential and population size. These results suggest that the mechanism of cross-seasonal effects between winter habitat and reproduction in ducks occurs through a reduction in the strength of density dependence in years of above-average wintering-ground precipitation. We suggest additional investigation of the underlying mechanisms and that habitat managers and decision-makers consider the level of uncertainty in these estimates when attempting to integrate habitat management and harvest management decisions. Collection of annual data on the status of wintering-ground habitat in a rigorous sampling framework would likely be the most direct way to improve understanding of mechanisms and inform management. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016},

abstract={In spite of recent developments in tracking technology, leg bands are still the main marking method in songbird population studies. Yet, band-related injury rates and the effects of such injuries on survival and reproductive success have rarely been documented in songbirds. Over a 9-year period, we banded 525 male Ovenbirds using a numbered aluminum band and three celluloid color bands. Of these, 322 individuals returned to our study area in at least one of the subsequent years, including four males (1.2%) missing a foot. In all cases, foot loss occurred 2-3 years after banding, suggesting indirect effects of bands rather than injuries sustained at the time of capture or banding. Among returning individuals, 91 were recaptured and only one had noticeable leg injuries that did not result in foot loss. Three of the four males missing a foot were able to fledge young, one of which produced young during two successive breeding seasons. The fact that injured males could hold territories overlapping their previous one and produce young suggests that they could forage efficiently. Although leg injuries may carry a cost over the longer term, two of the four injured males were re-sighted in our study area the year following the first observation of foot loss. Our results, along with those of other studies, suggest that the benefits of bird banding greatly outweigh the costs associated with potential injuries, at least in this ground-foraging forest songbird.},

abstract={Avian research that involves potential disturbance to the study species may have unintended fitness consequences and could lead to biases in measurements of interest. The effects of band resighting on the behavior of mixed-species flocks of staging waterbirds were evaluated against recreational pedestrian activity that was expected to cause flushing. We found a model with additive effects of distance (near, 0-50 m, or far, 50-200 m) and disturbance type (researcher or pedestrian) best explained flock behaviors. The proportion of staging flocks that flushed in response to pedestrians was greatest when pedestrians were within 50 m of the flock. Virtually no flushes were observed in response to researchers, regardless of distance. These results could assist in alleviating concerns that accepted protocols used for intensive band resighting studies on staging seabirds of special conservation status, such as Roseate (Sterna dougallii) and Common (S. hirundo) terns, may have adverse effects. Our framework could be used by others to test the effects of similar research on sensitive species.},

abstract={Data to inform population assessment of the Interior subspecies of band-tailed pigeon, Patagioenas fasciata fasciata (breeding range from Colorado and Utah south into Sierra Madre Occidental of Mexico), have been lacking despite substantial past banding efforts. We used a data set of more than 26,000 bandings from Colorado, with 3,500 live recaptures and 780 recoveries from the harvest of banded individuals to estimate annual survival, fidelity, and harvest rates. Most birds were harvested in Colorado (62%) followed by Mexico (18%); New Mexico (16%); Arizona (3%); and 1% or less each in California, Washington, and Utah. On average, each year 15% (range 0-30%) of surviving band-tailed pigeons did not return to Colorado. From 1969 to 1981 mean annual survival was 0.633 (standard error [SE]=0.031) for hatch-year and 0.719 (SE=0.016) for after-hatch-year birds, with a mean annual recovery rate of 0.015 (SE=0.002) for hatch-year and 0.011 (SE = 0.001) for after-hatch-year birds. From 1970 to 1974, mean annual abundance of bandtailed pigeons in Colorado on 1 September was 59,911-88,290.

abstract={Taking brood flush counts is a common sampling method that has been used for decades to estimate brood and chick survival in many gallinaceous bird species. However, brood survival estimates based upon flush counts may be biased because of low detection probabilities, occurrence of brood amalgamations, brood abandonment, and brooding adult mortality. Given that brood flush counts are still commonly used to estimate brood survival, and in some cases extrapolated to provide an estimate of chick survival, it is important to evaluate biases associated with this method. Therefore, we evaluated the use of brood flush counts to estimate brood survival of 2 gallinaceous birds: Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and Scaled Quail (Callipepla squamata). To gain a better understanding of some of the mechanisms that may bias brood survival estimates, we radio-tagged Northern Bobwhite and Scaled Quail chicks (8-12 days old) and juveniles (4-6 weeks old) in 67 broods. We used radio-tagged chicks and juveniles to estimate and compare brood survival using 2 analysis methodologies. These methods included a telemetry method that relied upon radio-tagged chicks and a flush method that mimicked a brood flush count. In bobwhites, the brood survival estimates were higher with the telemetry-based estimate than with the flush estimate for both the 3-week chick (0.808 vs. 0.500) and 5-week juvenile (0.636 vs. 0.364). In Scaled Quail, the 2 brood survival estimates were similar at the chick (0.842 vs. 0.789) and juvenile (0.818 vs. 0.818) life stages. Because Scaled Quail have lower occurrences of brooding adult mortality and brood abandonment, flush counts provided a more accurate estimate of brood survival for Scaled Quail than for bobwhites. In situations where brood abandonment or brooding adult mortality is common, researchers using flush counts to investigate gallinaceous brood survival should consider the impact that these mechanisms may have on survival estimates.},

abstract={Marking birds is a vital tool for determining survival, habitat-use patterns, and movements. For galliform species, metal leg bands and radio-transmitters are widely used marking techniques. While commonly used on adult birds, leg banding and radio-marking of galliform chicks are not commonly employed. During a two-year study to evaluate survival, dispersal, and habitat-use of released four-week old ring-necked pheasants Phasianus colchicus, we sought to mark chicks in a manner that allowed us to track them post-release and recognize them if harvested as adults. Our objectives were to evaluate the efficacy of four banding techniques: 1) standard bands for adult ring-necked pheasants [no. 6 aluminum butt-end bands], 2) colored plastic spiral leg bands commonly used for banding poultry, 3) no. 6 bands and plastic spiral leg bands to prevent the aluminum bands from slipping off, and 4) cotton-filled no. 6 bands to prevent bands from slipping off and allow growth of the tarsus. We also evaluated two radio-transmitter attachment methods: gluing or suturing transmitters on the back of four-week-old chicks. The no. 6 bands did not stay attached to the birds due to the bands being too large, and plastic spiral bands commonly caused constriction of the legs, possibly crippling birds. However, using cotton filled leg-bands was a reliable method for marking pheasant chicks. Although gluing has been used successfully as a radio-transmitter attachment method in other studies, in our study it largely failed given that few radio-transmitters remained attached beyond two days. Suturing was an effective method (90% of the transmitters remained attached until death or expected life of the battery) for attaching radio-transmitters to ring-necked pheasant chicks. Our field study has revealed promising approaches and we suggest that a captive study should now evaluate the possible sub-lethal effects (e.g. growth rates, body condition, transmitter retention times) of these attachment methods. © 2017 The Authors.},

abstract={Postfledging survival of neotropical migrant songbirds has been linked to seasonal and annual changes in the environment and to individual condition. Understanding what influences variation in postfledging movements may provide insight into the differential value of habitat across life-history stages. We conducted a radio-telemetry study of postfledging ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla; n = 45) and Acadian flycatchers (Empidonax virescens; n = 62) in mature-forest fragments from 2012 to 2015 in Missouri, USA. We documented variability in behavior and space use and used generalized linear mixed models to evaluate the relationship of postfledging movement rates to individuals’ condition, temporal variables, and local habitat variables. We found effects of age and season on movement distances for both study species. Additionally, daily movements of fledgling ovenbirds were negatively related to understory foliage density, a characteristic previously linked to increased survival. Habitat features are useful in predicting the postfledging movements of ovenbirds. By including behavioral development (age) and season in movement models, we were able to isolate and detect habitat effects on movement of ovenbirds and Acadian flycatchers. We suggest researchers use models of daily movement to further strengthen resource quality hypotheses generated by habitat selection and survival studies. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2016},

abstract={We describe a new collaborative network, the Motus Wildlife Tracking System (Motus; https://motus.org), which is an international network of researchers using coordinated automated radio-telemetry arrays to study movements of small flying organisms including birds, bats, and insects, at local, regional, and hemispheric scales. Radio-telemetry has been a cornerstone of tracking studies for over 50 years, and because of current limitations of geographic positioning systems (GPS) and satellite transmitters, has remained the primary means to track movements of small animals with high temporal and spatial precision. Automated receivers, along with recent miniaturization and digital coding of tags, have further improved the utility of radio-telemetry by allowing many individuals to be tracked continuously and simultaneously across broad landscapes. Motus is novel among automated arrays in that collaborators employ a single radio frequency across receiving stations over a broad geographic scale, allowing individuals to be detected at sites maintained by others. Motus also coordinates, disseminates, and archives detections and associated metadata in a central repository. Combined with the ability to track many individuals simultaneously, Motus has expanded the scope and spatial scale of research questions that can be addressed using radio-telemetry from local to regional and even hemispheric scales. Since its inception in 2012, more than 9000 individuals of over 87 species of birds, bats, and insects have been tracked, resulting in more than 250 million detections. This rich and comprehensive dataset includes detections of individuals during all phases of the annual cycle (breeding, migration, and nonbreeding), and at a variety of spatial scales, resulting in novel insights into the movement behavior of small flying animals. The value of the Motus network will grow as spatial coverage of stations and number of partners and collaborators increases. With continued expansion and support, Motus can provide a framework for global collaboration, and a coordinated approach to solving some of the most complex problems in movement biology and ecology. © 2017 by the author(s).},

abstract={In sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) ecosystems, encroachment of pinyon (Pinus spp.) and juniper (Juniperus spp.; hereafter, "pinyon-junipeR&Rdquo;) trees has increased dramatically since European settlement. Understanding the impacts of this encroachment on behavioral decisions, distributions, and population dynamics of greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) and other sagebrush obligate species could help benefit sagebrush ecosystem management actions. We employed a novel two-stage Bayesian model that linked avoidance across different levels of pinyon-juniper cover to sage-grouse survival. Our analysis relied on extensive telemetry data collected across 6 yr and seven subpopulations within the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment (DPS), on the border of Nevada and California. The first model stage indicated avoidance behavior for all canopy cover classes on average, but individual grouse exhibited a high degree of heterogeneity in avoidance behavior of the lowest cover class (e.g., scattered isolated trees). The second stage modeled survival as a function of estimated avoidance parameters and indicated increased survival rates for individuals that exhibited avoidance of the lowest cover class. A post hoc frailty analysis revealed the greatest increase in hazard (i.e., mortality risk) occurred in areas with scattered isolated trees consisting of relatively high primary plant productivity. Collectively, these results provide clear evidence that local sage-grouse distributions and demographic rates are influenced by pinyon-juniper, especially in habitats with higher primary productivity but relatively low and seemingly benign tree cover. Such areas may function as ecological traps that convey attractive resources but adversely affect population vital rates. To increase sage-grouse survival, our model predictions support reducing actual pinyon-juniper cover as low as 1.5%, which is lower than the published target of 4.0%. These results may represent effects of pinyon-juniper cover in areas with similar ecological conditions to those of the Bi-State DPS, where populations occur at relatively high elevations and pinyon-juniper is abundant and widespread. © 2017 The Society for Range Management.

abstract={Context The ability to identify priority habitat is critical for species of conservation concern. The designation of critical habitat under the US Endangered Species Act 1973 identifies areas occupied by the species that are important for conservation and may need special management or protection. However, relatively few species' critical habitats designations incorporate habitat suitability models or seasonal specificity, even when that information exists. Gunnison sage-grouse (GUSG) have declined substantially from their historical range and were listed as threatened by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) in November 2014. GUSG are distributed into eight isolated populations in Colorado and Utah, and one population, the Gunnison Basin (GB), has been the focus of much research. Aims To provide season-specific resource selection models to improve targeted conservation actions within the designated critical habitat in the GB. Methods We utilised radio-telemetry data from GUSG captured and monitored from 2004 to 2010. We were able to estimate resource selection models for the breeding (1 April-15 July) and summer (16 July-30 September) seasons in the GB using vegetation, topographical and anthropogenic variables. We compared the seasonal models with the existing critical habitat to investigate whether the more specific seasonal models helped identify priority habitat for GUSG. Key results The predictive surface for the breeding model indicated higher use of large areas of sagebrush, whereas the predictive surface for the summer model predicted use of more diverse habitats. The breeding and summer models (combined) matched the current critical habitat designation 68.5% of the time. We found that although the overall habitat was similar between the critical habitat designation and our combined models, the pattern and configuration of the habitat were very different. Conclusions These models highlight areas with favourable environmental variables and spatial juxtaposition to establish priority habitat within the critical habitat designated by USFWS. More seasonally specific resource selection models will assist in identifying specific areas within the critical habitat designation to concentrate habitat improvements, conservation and restoration within the GB. Implications This information can be used to provide insight into the patterns of seasonal habitat selection and can identify priority GUSG habitat to incorporate into critical habitat designation for targeted management actions. © CSIRO 2017.},

abstract={There are significant discrepancies among the published descriptions of the ranges of California's two subspecies of the White-breasted Nuthatch, Sitta carolinensis aculeata and S. c. tenuissima. To reevaluate the relationship between their ranges in the state, we recorded observations along the west edge of the range of S. c. tenuissima and the east edge of the range of S. c. aculeata, identifying birds to subspecies by diagnostic vocalizations. We made 457 observations in which the subspecies could be confirmed vocally. We found that the two subspecies are generally well separated in the north-central portions of the Sierra Nevada, with S. c. aculeata found well west of the crest and S. c. tenuissima east of the crest or at the higher elevations on the west side. The relatively wide band of dense fir {Abies spp.) and mixed conifer forest at the middle to lower elevations of the west side likely forms a barrier between them. In the southern Sierra and at the southern edge of the Cascades, the two subspecies come into close contact and we found evidence suggesting intergradation in the latter area.},

abstract={The use of digital VHF telemetry is expanding as a lightweight alternative to satellite-based technologies for tracking bird movements, though few studies have compared how they perform. During 2013, satellite telemetry and digital VHF telemetry were compared for estimating the length of stay and home ranges of American Oystercatchers (Haematopus palliatus) on their breeding grounds in Massachusetts, USA. American Oystercatchers (n = 5) were captured at their nest sites and tagged with a 9.5-g solar-powered satellite transmitter and a 1.0-g digitally coded VHF transmitter, and tracked using the Argos satellite system, an array of eight automated radio telemetry stations, and periodic land-based and aerial telemetry surveys. Estimates of mean minimum length of stay in the study area were slightly longer for satellite telemetry at 118 ± 12 days vs. digital VHF telemetry at 108 ± 11 days. Size estimates of mean (± SE) fixed kernel 95% utilization distributions were similar for satellite telemetry (22.53 ± 16.87 km2) and VHF telemetry (27.27 ± 21.58 km2). Despite a small sample size, digital VHF telemetry, when combined with automated radio telemetry stations and telemetry surveys, performed similarly to satellite telemetry for estimating timing and home range size of shorebirds on their breeding grounds.},

abstract={Gradual changes in agricultural and landscape management practices have led to growing uncertainty regarding eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) habitat management in contemporary landscapes in the midwestern United States. Nesting and brood-rearing success during spring often influence turkey population trajectories, and a better understanding of habitat selection during this period would identify potential habitat characteristics that have the greatest influence on turkey population management objectives. We evaluated spring (8 Apr–24 Jul) habitat selection of 89 radio-marked female wild turkeys across 4 study areas (2 forest-dominated, and 2 agricultural) in southwest and west-central Wisconsin, USA, 2010–2011. We investigated habitat selection at 3 hierarchical spatial scales: study areas, within spring areas of use (SAUs), and within 200 m of nest sites. We obtained 3,605 radio-telemetry relocations x = 30.8 ± 0.51 [SE] locations/turkey) and monitored 79 nesting attempts. In both landscapes, female turkeys selected edges, and in forested landscapes females selected for deciduous forests with numerous and dispersed forest openings. Female turkeys generally established SAUs where an even mixture of forest and open-herbaceous cover was available. Telemetry locations within SAUs indicated female turkeys selected land cover types in proportion to availability (Ŝi = 1), but selection of specific cover types was variable within and among study areas. At the nest site scale, amount of forest-field edge was greater within 200 m of nest sites x = 62.2 m/ha) compared to random locations x = 48.3 m/ha). Coarse measures of forest and open-agricultural cover were useful in identifying habitat selection trends by female turkeys across hierarchical scales. Our results suggest that proportion and configuration of forest and open-agricultural cover are essential components of female turkey habitat, and forest-field edge further plays an important role in nest site selection. We suggest conservation efforts focus on ensuring available usable space through maintaining upland deciduous woodlands or providing herbaceous fields in varying degrees of succession when managing for wild turkey populations in mixed forest-agricultural landscapes. Adaptability of wild turkeys indicates the importance of multi-scale habitat evaluation prior to implementing habitat management strategies. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017},

abstract={Advanced reproductive technologies (ART's) are often employed with various taxa to enhance captive breeding programs and maintain genetic diversity. Perivitelline membrane-bound (PVM-bound) sperm detection has previously been demonstrated in avian and chelonian species as a useful technique for breeding management. In the absence of embryotic development within an egg, this technique can detect the presence of sperm trapped on the oocyte membrane confirming breeding, male reproductive status, and pair compatibility. PVM-bound sperm were successfully detected in three clutches of Cuban crocodile (Crocodylus rhombifer) eggs at the Smithsonian's National Zoological Park (NZP) for the first time in any crocodilian species. PVM-bound sperm were detected in fresh and incubated C. rhombifer eggs, as well as eggs that were developing (banded) and those that were not (not banded). The results of this study showed significant differences in average sperm densities per egg between clutches (p = 0.001). Additionally, there was not a significant difference within clutches between eggs that banded and those that did not band (Clutch A, p = 0.505; Clutch B, p = 0.665; Clutch C, p = 0.266). The results of this study demonstrate the necessity to microscopically examine eggs that do not develop (do not band), to determine if sperm is present, which can help animal managers problem solve reproductive shortcomings. PVM-bound sperm detection could be a useful technique in assessing crocodilian breeding programs, as well as have potential uses in studies assessing sperm storage, artificial insemination, and artificial incubation.

abstract={Increasing concern for environmental sustainability, the demand for domestic energy, and an impetus on reducing dependence on fossil fuels have led to substantial investment in renewable energies including wind energy over the last 2 decades. Increases in wind energy development are especially noticeable in prairie habitats with high wind capacity. This has raised concerns over effects on grouse species including greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus). We monitored 346 female greater sage-grouse via telemetry from 2009 to 2014 in southeastern Wyoming, within a control area and an area influenced by a wind energy development to estimate the potential effects of wind energy infrastructure on greater sage-grouse habitat selection and demography. We developed resource selection functions by comparing habitats used to habitats available relative to the wind energy development during the nesting, brood-rearing, and summer periods. In addition, we used survival models to estimate the variability in nest, brood, and female survival relative to the wind energy development. The relative probability of greater sage-grouse selecting brood-rearing and summer habitats decreased as percentage of surface disturbance associated with the facility infrastructure increased. We did not, however, detect a negative effect of the wind energy facility on nest site selection or on nest, brood-rearing, or female survival during the study. Future wind energy developments should consider the potential effects of wind energy development on sage-grouse habitat selection patterns and survival parameters ≤1.20 km from any occupied sage-grouse nesting, brood-rearing, or summer habitats. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017},

abstract={Adults and juveniles of some forest breeding birds shift habitat use during the post breeding season from late to early successional forest. Juveniles of smaller passerine species are difficult to radio-track, and there is limited information on their habitat preferences, especially once they become older and independent. We determined if independent hatch-year birds captured in early-successional habitat remained there for extended periods, or if these habitats were only occupied infrequently during foraging activities. We determined habitat use for Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla), Worm-eating Warblers (Helmitheros vermivorum) and Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) during the independent post-fledging period in the Missouri Ozarks. We placed radio transmitters on 29 hatch-year birds captured in clearcuts and attempted to relocate them for 24 days in the summer of 2012. All three species had a greater relative probability of use of clearcut forest stands with small trees than older forests. Ovenbirds and Worm-eating Warblers remained in the early-successional habitat where initially captured, whereas Red-eyed Vireos used both late and early-successional habitat. Management efforts have primarily focused on breeding habitat for migratory songbirds, but the post-breeding period could be equally important given that hatch-year birds can spend an equal or greater amount of time in this stage. More information is needed to determine how widespread this habitat shift is for mature forest-breeding birds.},

abstract={The movements and behavior of many taxa of seabirds during the non-breeding season remain poorly known. For example, although studies conducted in the Pacific and Indian oceans suggest that White-tailed Tropicbirds (Phaethon lepturus) seldom fly more than a few thousand kilometers from nest colonies after breeding, little is known about the post-breeding movements and behavior of a subspecies of White-tailed Tropicbirds (P. l. catesbyi) that breeds on islands in the North Atlantic Ocean. Our objective, therefore, was to use light-based geolocators to identify the ranges and pelagic activities of White-tailed Tropicbirds from Bermuda during the non-breeding periods in 2014–2015 (N = 25) and 2015–2016 (N = 16). Locations were estimated based on changes in light intensity across time, and pelagic activities were determined based on whether geolocators attached to leg bands were wet (i.e., birds resting on the water's surface) or dry (i.e., birds in flight). In 2014, birds spent late summer (July–September) near Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands; by mid-September, most (N = 17; 68%) birds took a direct easterly route to the Sargasso Sea. In 2015, most post-breeders (N = 15; 94%) flew east from Bermuda and to the Sargasso before the end of late summer. For both years combined, fall and winter (October–February) ranges extended as far west as North Carolina and as far east as the mid-Atlantic Ridge. In both years, all birds were located between Bermuda and the British Virgin Islands during the spring (April–May). All birds then flew north to Bermuda in both years, with variations in timing, during April and May. We also found extensive overlap in the ranges of males and females during the non-breeding season in both years. During the non-breeding season, White-tailed Tropicbirds spent 5% of night periods and 41% of day periods in flight in 2014; in 2015, birds spent 8% and 42% of night and day periods, respectively, in flight. Tropicbirds spent more time flying during the day because they hunt by day, detecting prey on the wing by sight. Overall, our results suggest that White-tailed Tropicbirds that breed in Bermuda are diurnal, nomadic wanderers that range over an extensive area of the Atlantic Ocean during the non-breeding season. © 2017 Association of Field Ornithologists},

We used abundance, banding, and harvest data from throughout the Pacifc Flyway and other important source areas in the Central Flyway to estimate the distribution and derivation of Pacifc Flyway dabbling duck harvests during 1966-2013. Although most of the combined Pacifc Flyway dabbling duck harvest was derived from Alaskan and Canadian sources, each Pacifc Flyway state relied extensively on within-state production for at least some species, especially mallards (Anas platyrhynchos), gadwalls (Mareca strepera), cinnamon teal (Spatula cyanoptera), and wood ducks (Aix sponsa). Harvest from California was especially diverse, including large proportions of ducks produced in California in addition to migrants from throughout the Pacifc and Central Flyways. Although the Pacifc Flyway has long been recognized as a critical wintering area for dabbling ducks, our analyses indicate it is also an important production area for several species. Sustaining future waterfowl harvests will require continued recognition of the diverse production origins of waterfowl that winter in the Pacifc Flyway.},

abstract={The ability of organisms to disperse across urban landscapes is theorized to be constrained by habitat fragmentation. While previous research has shown the distribution of forest patches is a determinant of dispersal patterns among forest-obligate bird species, the impacts of habitat distribution on the dispersal of "urban-adapted" species, has yet to be examined. Here, we use capture-reencounter data of birds banded over a 9-year period at six banding stations in greater Washington, DC to assess dispersal in four species of songbirds and a translocation experiment to examine the influence of land cover on movement. Point count and land cover data were used to construct habitat suitability and landscape permeability surfaces, with the latter representing potential travels costs from the capture location to the surrounding landscape. To assess how dispersal processes are affected by urban land cover, we searched for previously banded birds at sampling locations within 1.5 km of each banding station and compared the distribution of sampling locations with and without observations of previously-banded birds. We found evidence that settlement of two of four focal species, the Northern Cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis) and Gray Catbird (Dumetella carolinensis), was more likely in sites with high relative permeability. To experimentally explore the consequences of the urban matrix habitat on movement, we attached radio transmitters to male Cardinals, translocated individuals 1.5 km across high-intensity urban, suburban, and forested landscapes, and recorded the time to return to their territory. Return time was dependent on land cover with Cardinals translocated across suburban habitats returning significantly faster than those moved across the other two land use classes. Combined, our findings suggest that, even among some "urban-adapted" species, dispersal within urban environments may be influenced by landscape structure and composition. © 2017 Evans, Kilpatrick, Hurlbert and Marra.},

abstract={The likelihood of encountering a predator influences prey behavior and spatial distribution such that non-consumptive effects can outweigh the influence of direct predation. Prey species are thought to filter information on perceived predator encounter rates in physical landscapes into a landscape of fear defined by spatially explicit heterogeneity in predation risk. The presence of multiple predators using different hunting strategies further complicates navigation through a landscape of fear and potentially exposes prey to greater risk of predation. The juxtaposition of land cover types likely influences overlap in occurrence of different predators, suggesting that attributes of a landscape of fear result from complexity in the physical landscape. Woody encroachment in grasslands furnishes an example of increasing complexity with the potential to influence predator distributions. We examined the role of vegetation structure on the distribution of two avian predators, Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo jamaicensis) and Northern Harrier (Circus cyaneus), and the vulnerability of a frequent prey species of those predators, Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus). We mapped occurrences of the raptors and kill locations of Northern Bobwhite to examine spatial vulnerability patterns in relation to landscape complexity. We use an offset model to examine spatially explicit habitat use patterns of these predators in the Southern Great Plains of the United States, and monitored vulnerability patterns of their prey species based on kill locations collected during radio telemetry monitoring. Both predator density and predation-specific mortality of Northern Bobwhite increased with vegetation complexity generated by fine-scale interspersion of grassland and woodland. Predation pressure was lower in more homogeneous landscapes where overlap of the two predators was less frequent. Predator overlap created areas of high risk for Northern Bobwhite amounting to 32% of the land area where landscape complexity was high and 7% where complexity was lower. Our study emphasizes the need to evaluate the role of landscape structure on predation dynamics and reveals another threat from woody encroachment in grasslands. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Migration allows animals to live in resource-rich but seasonally variable environments. Because of the costs of migration, there is selective pressure to capitalize on variation in weather to optimize migratory performance. To test the degree to which migratory performance (defined as speed of migration) of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) was determined by age-And season-specific responses to variation in weather, we analyzed 1,863 daily tracks (n = 83 migrant eagles) and 8,047 hourly tracks (n = 83) based on 15 min GPS telemetry data from Golden Eagles and 277 hourly tracks based on 30 s data (n = 37). Spring migrant eagles traveled 139.75 ± 82.19 km day-1 (mean ± SE; n = 57) and 25.59 ± 11.75 km hr-1 (n = 55). Autumn migrant eagles traveled 99.14 ± 59.98 km day-1 (n = 26) and 22.18 ± 9.18 km hr-1 (n = 28). Weather during migration varied by season and by age class. During spring, best-supported daily and hourly models of 15 min data suggested that migratory performance was influenced most strongly by downward solar radiation and that older birds benefited less from flow assistance (tailwinds). During autumn, best-supported daily and hourly models of 15 min data suggested that migratory performance was influenced most strongly by south-north winds and by flow assistance, again less strongly for older birds. In contrast, models for hourly performance based on data collected at 30 s intervals were not well described by a single model, likely reflecting eagles' rapid responses to the many weather conditions they experienced. Although daily speed of travel was similar for all age classes, younger birds traveled at faster hourly speeds than did adults. Our analyses uncovered strong, sometimes counterintuitive, relationships among weather, experience, and migratory flight, and they illustrate the significance of factors other than age in determining migratory performance. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Animals inhabiting disturbance-prone systems, such as the northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) in pine (Pinus spp.) savanna, are adapted to certain intensities of disturbance (e.g., frequency, spatial extent, seasonality). Management practices attempt to mimic these natural conditions. Even though northern bobwhites are known as the firebird, most fire-related management is currently based on tradition and limited peer-reviewed literature. We studied habitat selection of northern bobwhites on private property in Georgetown County, South Carolina, USA, managed with fire, winter disking, and supplemental feeding. We radio-tagged 338 individual bobwhites and monitored them 3–4 times weekly via very high frequency (VHF) telemetry for 2 years. We used hierarchical habitat selection functions in a Bayesian framework to model the data. We considered 2 spatial scales: the study site (second-order) and within home ranges (third-order). Bobwhites selected for small burns during the breeding season but had the highest selection for areas intermediately distant from burn edges during winter (i.e., 67 m). Bobwhites had the strongest selection for fire return intervals of 2–3 years during winter but 1–2 years during the breeding season. Use of supplemental feed was strong across seasons but not selected for by brooding birds within their home range. Use of fallow fields was strongest for brooding birds. Our results are useful for bobwhite managers, especially those in subtropical climates, because they provide scientifically defensible information supporting the use of prescribed fire, winter disking, and supplemental feeding in the context of habitat use. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017},

abstract={Temperate species occupying habitats at the northern limit of their geographical distribution are limited by weather and climatic conditions. Such conditions often directly affect population dynamics, and thus, influence shifts in distribution via changes in demographic parameters. We examined this question by following three distinct populations of wild turkeys inhabiting areas exposed to a gradient of meteorological conditions at the northern limit of the species distribution. Four years of radio-telemetry on 181 birds and monitoring of 95 nests revealed that population demographics of wild turkeys were influenced by snow depth, winter temperature and summer rainfall. During winter, survival of turkeys decreased drastically when snow depth remained >30 cm for >10 days and also decreased as temperatures got colder. In the spring, snow persistence delayed nest initiation, whereas nest survival was negatively affected by rainfall. Our findings show that the effects of critical meteorological factors such as snow and temperature can be compounded when both reach the limit of a species tolerance simultaneously. © 2017, The Society of Population Ecology and Springer Japan KK.},

abstract={Species distribution models can provide critical baseline distribution information for the conservation of poorly understood species. Here, we compared the performance of band-tailed pigeon (Patagioenas fasciata) species distribution models created using Maxent and derived from two separate presence-only occurrence data sources in New Mexico: 1) satellite tracked birds and 2) observations reported in eBird basic data set. Both models had good accuracy (test AUC &gt; 0.8 and True Skill Statistic &gt; 0.4), and high overlap between suitability scores (I statistic 0.786) and suitable habitat patches (relative rank 0.639). Our results suggest that, at the state-wide level, eBird occurrence data can effectively model similar species distributions as satellite tracking data. Climate change models for the band-tailed pigeon predict a 35% loss in area of suitable climate by 2070 if CO2 emissions drop to 1990 levels by 2100, and a 45% loss by 2070 if we continue current CO2 emission levels through the end of the century. These numbers may be conservative given the predicted increase in drought, wildfire, and forest pest impacts to the coniferous forests the species inhabits in New Mexico. The northern portion of the species’ range in New Mexico is predicted to be the most viable through time. © 2017},

abstract={Effective conservation requires an understanding of how species respond to management actions. For species of conservation concern such as greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), this understanding is urgently needed. We developed resource selection functions to assess the influence of mechanical treatments of mountain big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata vaseyana) on habitat selection by greater sage-grouse during the critical brooding period. We measured multiple vegetation components, including shrub, grass, and forb cover, at random locations before and after sagebrush treatments. We then used model selection and a 19-yr telemetry data set (1998-2016) to evaluate response of greater sage-grouse to treatments. Statistical models were built using 418 locations from 72 females with broods (333 locations, 61 females pretreatment; 85 locations, 11 females post treatment). Using a difference in means comparison, we found shrub canopy cover decreased (mean ± SE) from 31.81% ± 0.70% to 16.16% ± 0.89% following mechanical treatment. Grass cover increased from 12.02%± 0.51% to 31.33% ± 1.52% after treatment. Post-treatment forb cover (12.58% ± 1.23%) did not differ from pretreatment estimates (12.39% ± 0.61%). Overall, greater sage-grouse selected areas that were 1) distant from trees, paved roads, and powerlines; 2) high in elevation; 3) near treatment edges; and 4) consisting of gentle slopes. Post-treatment sage-grouse showed stronger selection for treatments and treatment edges than did pretreatment sage-grouse. Maps predicting probability of selection by brood-rearing sage-grouse showed increased use in and around mechanically treated areas. This altered pattern of selection by sage-grouse with broods suggests mechanical treatments may be a suitable way to increase use of mountain big sagebrush during the brooding period. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={Background: Regional scale movement patterns of songbirds are poorly known largely due to difficulties tracking small organisms at broad scales. Using an array of over 100 automated radio telemetry towers, we followed Blackpoll Warblers (Setophaga striata) during fall migration in the Gulf of Maine region, and assessed how their regional scale movement pathways varied with age, distance to natal origin, and capture date. Results: Many individuals had movement paths that were not oriented towards their migratory goal ('indirect movement patterns'), regardless of age, distance to natal origin, or time of season. The probability of moving in indirect patterns, and the total tracking duration, decreased with capture date. The extent of indirect movement patterns varied considerably between individuals. Excluding direct flight patterns consistent with traditional migratory movements, adults tended to make more flights and moved in more tortuous patterns than hatch-years. Adults and individuals from more westerly natal origins were more likely to move south-west through time. Conclusions: A greater proportion of individuals made movements that were not oriented towards the migratory than expected. A decrease in tracking duration with capture date indicates that individuals prioritize time as the season progresses. The shorter, indirect movement patterns may be a more complete representation of 'reverse migration' at a barrier or 'landscape-scale stopovers movements'. The longer distances travelled are inconsistent with expected behaviour, even in front of a barrier. The extent of movement we observed indirectly suggests that flight is not as costly to individuals in a migratory state as is commonly assumed. Since adults were observed to move more than hatch-years, we suggest that the indirect movement patterns we observed are not accidental, and may provide some advantage to the individuals that undertake them. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={Altitudinal movement by tropical birds to track seasonally variable resources can move them from protected areas to areas of increased vulnerability. In Hawaiʻi, historical reports suggest that many Hawaiian honeycreepers such as the ‘I‘iwi (Drepanis coccinea) once undertook seasonal migrations, but the existence of such movements today is unclear. Because Hawaiian honeycreepers are highly susceptible to avian malaria, currently minimal in high-elevation forests, understanding the degree to which honeycreepers visit lower elevation forests may be critical to predict the current impact of malaria on population dynamics and how susceptible bird populations may respond to climate change and mitigation scenarios. Using radio telemetry data, we demonstrate for the first time that a large fraction of breeding adult and juvenile ‘I‘iwi originating from an upper-elevation (1,920 m) population at Hakalau Forest National Wildlife Refuge exhibit post-breeding movements well below the upper elevational limit for mosquitoes. Bloom data suggest seasonal variation in floral resources is the primary driver of seasonal movement for ‘I‘iwi. To understand the demographic implications of such movement, we developed a spatial individual-based model calibrated using previously published and original data. ʻI‘iwi dynamics were simulated backward in time, to estimate population levels in the absence of avian malaria, and forward in time, to assess the impact of climate warming as well as two potential mitigation actions. Even in disease-free ‘refuge’ populations, we found that breeding densities failed to reach the estimated carrying capacity, suggesting the existence of a seasonal “migration load” as a result of travel to disease-prevalent areas. We predict that ‘I‘iwi may be on the verge of extinction in 2100, with the total number of pairs reaching only ~ 0.2–12.3% of the estimated pre-malaria density, based on an optimistic climate change scenario. The probability of extinction of ‘I‘iwi populations, as measured by population estimates for 2100, is strongly related to their estimated migration propensity. Long-term conservation strategies likely will require a multi-pronged response including a reduction of malaria threats, habitat restoration and continued landscape-level access to seasonally variable nectar resources. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Solar-powered GPS transmitters linked to the GSM cellular transmission system are a powerful new tool for avian research. Data collection can be researcher programmed or use dynamic fix (DF) rates that are automatically adjusted in accordance with battery charge. Lack of prior knowledge of fix (location) collection rates represents an obstacle to designing studies with transmitters that use DF rates. We assessed the quantity and quality of data collected by a commercially available DF transmitter. To assess fix collection rates, factors influencing fix collection rates, GPS accuracy, and the ability of transmitters to differentiate movement from nonmovement, we used a combination of controlled static tests at known locations, deployments on free-ranging Black Vultures (Coragyps atratus) and Turkey Vultures (Cathartes aura), and motion tests. During static testing, transmitters often collected upwards of 500 fixes per day in open habitats with little cloud cover. Hourly fix rates varied, commonly reaching 1 fix min-1 at midday but dropping to 1 fix hr-1 at night. The numbers of daylight fixes collected during vulture deployments were greater on days with little cloud cover, positively correlated with increasing daily movement rates, and positively correlated with available daylight hours, likely due in part to increased solar radiation near the summer solstice. Mean horizontal GPS error was 7.8 m (± 12.2 m SD). Mean vertical error was 4.5 m (± 142 m) above true elevation. Speed records &gt; 0 km hr-1 were reliable indicators of movement provided a 3D fix was obtained. Overall, the transmitters that we evaluated provided large volumes of data, but the inability to control data collection schedules may prove problematic for some applications. DF solar-powered transmitters appear best suited for use with active species in open habitats, and least suitable for use with species that inhabit high latitudes year-round or spend considerable time under forest cover. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={The Eastern Population (EP) of greater sandhill cranes (Antigone canadensis tabida; cranes) is expanding in size and geographic range. Little information exists regarding the geographic extent of breeding, migration, and wintering ranges, migration chronology, or use of staging areas for cranes in the EP. To obtain these data, we attached solar global positioning system (GPS) platform transmitting terminals (PTTs) to 42 sandhill cranes and monitored daily locations from December 2009 through August 2014. On average, tagged cranes settled in summer areas during late-March in Minnesota (7%), Wisconsin (29%), Michigan, USA (21%), and Ontario, Canada (38%) and arrived at their winter terminus beginning mid-December in Indiana (15%), Kentucky (3%), Tennessee (45%), Georgia (5%), and Florida (32%). Cranes initiated spring migration beginning mid-February to their respective summer areas on routes similar to those used during fall migration. Twenty-five marked cranes returned to the same summer area after a second spring migration, of which 19 (76%) settled <3 km from the estimated mean center of the summer area of the previous year. During the 2010–2012 United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) Cooperative Fall Abundance Survey for cranes in the EP, we estimated that approximately 29–31% of cranes that summered in both Wisconsin and the Lower Peninsula of Michigan were not in areas included in the survey. The information we collected on crane movements provides insight into distribution and migration chronology that will aid in assessment of the current USFWS fall survey. In addition, information on specific use sites can assist state and federal managers to identify and protect key staging and winter areas particularly during current and future recreational harvest seasons. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017},

abstract={Annual banding programs have allowed the estimation of key demographic parameters for many populations of harvested wildlife, yet they often provide little insight into vital rate variation among seasonally occupied habitats or among regions with differing hunting regulations. For lesser snow geese (Chen caerulescens caerulescens) in the midcontinent of North America, rapid growth in abundance and the consequent implementation of special conservation measures present a scenario where seasonal mortality estimates would be highly valuable. We evaluated variation in hunting mortality of adult and young geese among 3 seasons (autumn, winter, and spring) based on annual banding data from breeding colonies north and south of 60°N latitude, and seasonal hunting recoveries from the United States and Canada. Using band-recovery models and data covering 1999 through 2015, we first estimated annual survival for geese of both age classes and breeding locations, and then subsequently used seasonal hunting recoveries to derive estimates of seasonal hunting mortality and annual non-hunting mortality. Simulation models validated the accuracy of this approach. Hunting mortality in winter generally exceeded that during spring and autumn, but our estimates suggested that hunting mortality represented a small fraction of annual mortality for adult and young birds. Consistent with recent studies, our estimates pointed to a greater harvest effect for the smaller subarctic population breeding near southern Hudson Bay, Canada, than for the large arctic population breeding farther north. Although mean kill rates were higher for young than adult geese, natural mortality for young was high and temporally variable, implying that some hunting mortality experienced by young geese during their first year could be compensated by natural causes of death. Natural (non-hunting) mortality and annual survival showed greater temporal variation than seasonal kill rates in adults and young geese, highlighting the importance of non-harvest factors (e.g., climate, habitat, population density) to the dynamics of these populations. These novel estimates of seasonal kill rates and non-hunting mortality contribute further support to the notion that internal dynamics of the lesser snow goose midcontinent population, including natural mortality and recruitment, currently influence population trajectory more than ongoing interventions through harvest management. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017},

abstract={Conserving wide-ranging animals requires knowledge about their year-round movements and resource use. Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) exhibit a wide range of movement patterns across North America. We combined tracking data from 571 Golden Eagles from multiple independent satellite-telemetry projects from North America to provide a comprehensive look at the magnitude and extent of these movements on a continental scale. We compared patterns of use relative to four alternative administrative and ecological mapping systems, namely Bird Conservation Regions (BCRs), U.S. administrative migratory bird flyways, Migratory Bird Joint Ventures, and Landscape Conservation Cooperatives. Our analyses suggested that eagles initially captured in eastern North America used space differently than those captured in western North America. Other groups of eagles that exhibited distinct patterns in space use included long-distance migrants from northern latitudes, and southwestern and Californian desert residents. There were also several groupings of eagles in the Intermountain West. Using this collaborative approach, we have identified large-scale movement patterns that may not have been possible with individual studies. These results will support landscape-scale conservation measures for Golden Eagles across North America. © 2017 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Little is known about the habitat use patterns and movement ecology of American common eiders (Somateria mollissima dresseri) despite potential negative impacts on habitat and eider populations from anthropogenic sources (e.g., oil spills, hunting, offshore wind energy facilities). We used satellite telemetry to quantify migratory phenology, home range size, winter site fidelity, and resource selection of adult female eiders (n = 24) from December 2011 to July 2013 that were captured during winter in southern New England, USA. Eiders spent 39% of their annual cycle in southern New England. In spring, eiders took an average of 16 days (range = 2–47) in 2012 and 20 days (range = 1–61) in 2013 to migrate from wintering grounds to summer areas, whereas the duration of fall migration averaged 47 days (range = 7–115). Eiders exhibited high site fidelity to wintering areas, with 83% of birds with active transmitters (n = 23) returning to the study area the following winter (2012–2013). Mean individual core use home ranges on wintering grounds averaged 38.5 km2 and 95% utilization distributions were 199.3 km2. Based on habitat selection models, eiders preferred shallow, nearshore waters that had relatively fine sediments and a high probability of hard bottom. We estimated that only 3% of our 6,212-km2 study area had a high relative probability of use by eiders. Future development (e.g., offshore wind energy developments) should avoid shallow, nearshore waters with hard bottoms preferred by eiders to minimize potential impacts. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017},

abstract={Sandhill cranes (Antigone canadensis) are long-lived birds with relatively low recruitment rates, making accurate knowledge of abundance and distribution critical for well-informed harvest management. Minnesota, USA, is one of few states containing portions of 2 distinct breeding populations of greater sandhill cranes (A. c. tabida)—the Mid-continent Population (MCP) and Eastern Population (EP). Historically, the breeding range of MCP cranes in Minnesota was restricted to the extreme northwestern portion of the state, whereas the breeding range of EP cranes was limited to the east–central part of the state with a large area of separation between the 2 populations. Whereas MCP cranes have exhibited stable population estimates over time, EP cranes are currently experiencing a significant increase in population size and a concurrent expansion of breeding range. Our objectives were to evaluate the current range boundaries of the 2 populations in Minnesota and determine whether the populations overlap on their breeding areas and autumn staging grounds. We captured and attached Global Positioning System–Global System for Mobile Communications transmitters to 50 cranes in the zone between the historical breeding-range boundaries of the 2 populations. Movements of cranes revealed that EP cranes have greatly expanded their breeding range in Minnesota while MCP cranes have experienced more moderate range expansion in the state. Results of this study provide the first documentation of overlap between the breeding ranges of EP and MCP sandhill cranes. Our results also suggest that staging areas in northwestern Minnesota, where recreational harvest targeted at MCP cranes was allowed beginning in 2010, are being used by both populations and there is overlap in migration corridors, as evidenced by 4 cranes that used both the Mississippi and Central Flyways. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017},

abstract={Since the mid 1990s, the number of black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans; brant) nests on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta (YKD), Alaska, USA, the historically predominant breeding area of brant, has declined steadily. This has caused researchers and managers to question if arctic breeding populations can compensate for the reduction in brant nests on the YKD. An important component of the assessment of brant population dynamics is having current estimates of first-year and adult survival. We banded brant at 4 locations in Arctic Alaska and western Canada, and at 1 location in the subarctic, the Tutakoke River (TR) colony on the YKD, 1990–2015. We used joint live and dead mark-recapture models to estimate first-year and adult (≥1 yr old) survival of brant. We also used band recovery rates from a Brownie model to assess temporal trends in band recovery rates of adult brant. First-year survival of brant hatched at TR declined from approximately 0.60 to <0.20 and, although first-year survival generally was higher for goslings marked in the Arctic, their survival declined from approximately 0.70 in the early 1990s to ≤0.45 in the 2010s. Annual survival of adult females decreased from an average of 0.881 (95% CI = 0.877–0.885) to 0.822 (95% CI = 0.815–0.829) at TR and from 0.851 (95% CI = 0.843–0.860) to 0.821 (95% CI = 0.805–0.836) in the Arctic, from 1990 to 2014. Band recovery rates of adults generally were <1.25% until the last several years of study, when they reached ≤3.5%. Although the current harvest rates may be partially additive to natural mortality, we do not believe that harvest is the main influence on the declines in survival. The general decline in survival rates of brant breeding across a large geographic area may be influenced by a reduction in the quality of migration and wintering ground habitats. We suggest an analysis of seasonal survival of brant to test the hypothesis that declining habitat quality on wintering or spring migration areas is reducing survival. Our results suggest that the number of breeding pairs at TR will continue to decline and also brings into question the ability of arctic breeding populations to grow at a rate necessary to offset the declines on the YKD. Researchers should continue to closely monitor survival and harvest rates of brant, and assess methods currently used to monitor their abundance. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017},

abstract={An experimental approach was used to investigate wintering waterfowl responses to introduced trail use at foraging sites with and without recreational trails in California, USA. Waterfowl were exposed to trail use in the form of two researchers walking levees adjacent to ponded habitat, and the number of waterfowl by species were compared before and after experimental walks in 40-m bands starting at the levee and extending 200 m into the ponds. The researchers recorded distances to the nearest individuals, responses of focal animals, and numbers of recreational trail users. The most numerous species were Ruddy Duck (Oxyura jamaicensis), Northern Shoveler (Anas clypeata), and scaup spp. (Aythya affinis and A. marila). Recreational trail use rates at trail sites averaged 1 to 82 people/hr. The greatest difference in numbers of birds before vs. after experimental walks occurred in the two 40-m bands closest to the levee at non-trail sites (0-40 m [t = 4.558, P = 0.0001], 40-80 m [t = 3.775, P = 0.001]) and trail sites (0-40 m [t = 3.049, P = 0.005], 40-80 m [t = 1.808, P = 0.082]). The relationship between the ratio of beforeto after-walk waterfowl numbers vs. date since the start of the winter season (r2 = 0.315, P = 0.102) and the total number of birds vs. the number of recreational trail users (r2 = 0.041, P = 0.847) did not indicate increasing tolerance to trail use for waterfowl overall. However, species varied in their tolerances. Ruddy Duck numbers declined with increasing numbers of recreational trail users (rho = -0.481, P = 0.017), while Northern Shoveler numbers increased (rho = 0.456, P = 0.025). Distances (using the 95th percentile) that individual birds were recorded from researchers during experimental walks varied from approximately 170-200 m at both non-trail and trail sites.},

abstract={The 2012 revision of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP) explicitly recognized the need to increase recruitment and retention of waterfowl hunters, birdwatchers, and other conservationists to maintain support for wetland conservation. The incorporation of human dimensions objectives within the NAWMP has compelled waterfowl and wetland managers to consider whether and to what extent landscape characteristics such as public land access; the type, amount, and location of wetlands; and site infrastructure will increase support for wetland conservation among user groups. Further, it has forced the waterfowl community to consider the possible trade-offs between managing land to achieve biological versus social objectives. We used publicly available, long-term data sets to illustrate a method of incorporating human dimensions into waterfowl habitat planning and management. We used United States Fish and Wildlife Service waterfowl harvest survey data, United States Geological Survey band encounter data, and Cornell Lab of Ornithology eBird data to summarize travel characteristics of wetland bird enthusiasts (i.e., waterfowl hunters and birdwatchers) in the Atlantic Flyway. Greater than 90% of all trips by wetland bird enthusiasts occurred within their state of residence. We used data from New York, USA, to demonstrate how to construct discrete choice recreation demand models to identify factors that influence site selection and participation. We demonstrate how model outputs, such as the expected change in the number and geographic distribution of recreational trips (i.e., hunting or birdwatching), can be used as an objective metric to evaluate the benefits of alternative habitat acquisition and restoration projects relative to the human dimensions objective of the NAWMP. These data and methods show promise for incorporating human dimensions objectives into habitat delivery and understanding potential trade-offs relative to biological objectives. Published 2017.

We made use of a regional-scale automated radio telemetry array to study stopover and migratory flights and migratory routes of blackpoll warblers Setophaga striata and red-eyed vireos Vireo olivaceus during fall migration in the Gulf of Maine, USA. We focused on differences between species, sexes, age groups, breeding origins, and time of year. Both species made within-stopover relocations (i.e. ‘stopover flights’) from the coastal capture site. Stopover flights were primarily oriented inland, and were more frequent for blackpolls (87%) than vireos (44%). By studying migratory behavior at a broad spatial scale, we demonstrated that most blackpolls and vireos took coastal and offshore routes through the Gulf of Maine, despite initially relocating inland from the capture site. Though we captured blackpolls and vireos from a broad breeding range, more than 70% of migratory flights from the capture site were oriented for coastal or offshore travel for both species, suggesting that birds actively chose coastal and offshore routes, and were not simply displaced by wind drift. Later vireos oriented offshore more frequently during migratory flights from the coast, indicating that they may be more inclined towards time-minimizing overwater flight routes and thus more exposed to coastal and offshore collision hazards than earlier conspecifics. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Movement behavior and its relationship to habitat provide critical information toward understanding the effects of changing environments on birds. The eastern North American population of Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) is a genetically distinct and small population of conservation concern. To evaluate the potential responses of this population to changing landscapes, we calculated the home range and core area sizes of 52 eagles of 6 age-sex classes during the summer and winter seasons. Variability in range size was related to variation in topography and open cover, and to age and sex. In summer, eagle ranges that were smaller had higher proportions of ridge tops and open cover and had greater topographic roughness than did larger ranges. In winter, smaller ranges had higher proportions of ridge tops, hillsides and cliffs, and open cover than did larger ranges. All age and sex classes responded similarly to topography and open cover in both seasons. Not surprisingly, adult eagles occupied the smallest ranges in both seasons. Young birds used larger ranges than adults, and subadults in summer used the largest ranges (&gt;.9,000 km2). Eastern adult home ranges in summer were 2-10 times larger than those reported for other populations in any season. Golden Eagles in eastern North America may need to compensate for generally lower-quality habitat in the region by using larger ranges that support access to adequate quantities of resources (prey, updrafts, and nesting, perching, and roosting sites) associated with open cover and diverse topography. Our results suggest that climate change-induced afforestation on the breeding grounds and ongoing land cover change from timber harvest and energy development on the wintering grounds may affect the amount of suitable habitat for Golden Eagles in eastern North America. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Populations of grassland birds that overwinter in the Chihuahuan Desert are declining more rapidly than other grassland birds, and survival during the non-breeding season may have a strong influence on population trends of these species. Habitat loss and deterioration due to desertification may be contributing to these declines, and the winter ecology of grassland birds under these changing environmental conditions remains relatively unexplored. To fill this information gap, we estimated the survival of two grassland-obligate sparrows, Baird's Sparrows (Ammodramus bairdii) and Grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum), on their wintering grounds in the Chihuahuan Desert, and investigated the role of habitat structure and weather on survival rates. We deployed radio-transmitters on Baird's (N = 49) and Grasshopper (N = 126) sparrows near Janos, Chihuahua, and tracked birds from November to March during the winters of 2012–2013 and 2013–2014. Causes of mortality included avian predators, mammals, and possibly weather. We estimated an overall weekly winter survival probability of ŝ = 92.73% (95% CI[s] = 88.63–95.44%) for Baird's Sparrows in 2012–2013. We estimated a weekly winter survival probability of ŝ = 93.48% (95% CI[s] = 90.29–96.67%) and ŝ = 98.78% (95% CI[s] = 97.88–99.68%) for Grasshopper Sparrow in 2012–2013 and 2013–2014, respectively. Weekly winter survival was lower with colder daily minimum temperatures for both species and in areas with taller shrubs for Grasshopper Sparrows, with the shrubs potentially increasing predation risk by providing perches for Loggerhead Shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus). Our results highlight the need to maintain healthy grass structure in wintering areas to provide birds with food, protection from predators, and adequate cover from inclement weather. Our results also demonstrate that the presence of shrubs can lower winter survival, and suggest that shrub encroachment into the winter habitat of these sparrows may be an important driver of their population declines. Shrub removal could increase survival of wintering sparrows in the Chihuahuan Desert by reducing availability of perches for avian predators, thus reducing predation risk. © 2017 Association of Field Ornithologists},

abstract={Understanding sex-specific differences in behavior and survival is essential for informative population modeling and evolutionary biology in animal populations. Uneven sex ratios are common in many migrant passerine species; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We used molecular sex determination, nest monitoring, and radio telemetry of fledgling Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla), to determine if sex-specific patterns of production, survival or behavior were present prior to the first migration. We tested whether: 1) sex ratios were skewed towards males at fledging; 2) postfledging survival of males was higher than females; 3) distances moved over time were equal between sexes; and 4) if observed parental care was equal between sexes over time. We determined the sex of 33 hatch-year Ovenbirds in central Missouri in 2015 and followed 19 individuals using radio telemetry. We found no difference in sex ratios within broods, overall numbers of male (n = 18) and female (n = 15) nestlings, or in the survival of male (n = 8) and female (n = 11) fledglings followed with radio telemetry. However, we did find that sex affected the relationship between age and distance moved from the nest, suggesting females moved further from the natal site after independence from adults. These results provide a better understanding of postfledging ecology and support the common assumption that annual production of females is half of total productivity, a fundamental premise in most population growth models. © 2017 Wilson Ornithological Society.

abstract={We conducted a 2-year study (2014–2015) in North Carolina, USA, to compare precision and efficiency between 2 methods used to estimate Canada goose (Branta canadensis) abundance. The first method (i.e., band-return estimation) used hunter band-returns and harvest estimates. The second (i.e., plot survey) used surveys of 1-km2 plots randomly located across potential goose habitat in the state. To quantify efficiency, we recorded all expenses and time dedicated to goose banding and plot surveys. In June 2014, we banded 2,102 adult geese at 44 sites. During the 2014–2015 hunting season, we received 173 direct band recoveries from birds banded as adults. We used the Lincoln–Peterson formula to calculate an abundance estimate of 148,839 (coeff. of variation = 7.9) and determined the band-return method required US $72,858 and 2,317 person-hours to complete. We surveyed 300 1-km2 plots across North Carolina in April 2015, and calculated an abundance estimate of 155,655 Canada geese (coeff. of variation = 308.9). We determined the plot-survey method required US $80,767 and 2,857 person-hours to complete. Although population estimates were similar, we recommend the band-return technique to estimate Canada goose abundance because it provided a more precise estimate with similar overall costs and, if continued for multiple years, will allow calculation of additional population metrics including survival, recovery rates, and harvest distributions. © 2017 The Authors.

abstract={A major challenge of wildlife telemetry is choosing an attachment technique that maximizes transmitter retention while minimizing negative side effects. For waterbirds, attachment of transmitters with subcutaneous anchors has been an effective and well-established technique, having been used on >40 species. This method was recently modified to include a second subcutaneous anchor, presumably increasing transmitter retention beyond that of single-anchor attachments. This putative benefit may be offset, however, by increased health risks related to additional incisions and subcutaneous protrusions. To test this potential trade-off, we attached radiotransmitters to molting and wintering surf (Melanitta perspicillata) and white-winged scoters (M. fusca) during 2008 and 2009 in Washington State and southeast Alaska, USA, using single- (121 scoters) and double-anchor (128 scoters) attachment techniques. We estimated daily probabilities of survival and radio retention for each group, this being apparent retention for wintering scoters because we could not differentiate shed transmitters from flighted emigration. For scoters during the flightless remigial molt, we found that addition of a second anchor increased cumulative retention probability (±SE) over a 49-day period from 0.69 ± 0.11 for single-anchor to 0.88 ± 0.07 for double-anchor attachments, while having no effect on survival. However, during winter, scoters with double-anchor attachments experienced no improvement in apparent retention, while having significantly lower survival during their first 14 days following transmitter attachment; of 15 mortalities during this period, 11 had 2 subcutaneous anchors. From day 15 onward, winter survival rates were nearly identical for single- versus double-anchor attachments, indicating that adverse effects of subcutaneous anchors were mainly limited to the 14-day postattachment period. Overall, given that the survival cost of adding a second subcutaneous anchor was substantial for wintering scoters—decreasing 14-day survival by 12% for adults and 23% for juveniles—we recommend that researchers opt for single-anchor attachments under most circumstances, especially during winter when birds may be energetically challenged.

abstract={Dispersal is a ubiquitous behavior with important consequences for gene flow, demography, and conservation. Some birds engage in between-year breeding dispersal, but the factors shaping variation in this behavior are not well understood. In mid-continental grasslands, preliminary evidence suggested that Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) dispersed not only between seasons, but also within breeding seasons-an apparently uncommon avian behavior. We studied a population of Grasshopper Sparrows breeding in northeastern Kansas, USA, to document the spatial and temporal patterns of within-season breeding dispersal in an experimentally managed tallgrass prairie from 2013 to 2015. We combined color-band resighting, territory mapping, and radio telemetry to quantify changes in territory density, turnover of territorial males, and dispersal distances. Density of Grasshopper Sparrows varied seasonally in management-specific ways, simultaneously increasing and decreasing in watersheds that differed in management regime. Turnover was unexpectedly high, with over half of territorial males being replaced each month. We documented over a third of males dispersing up to ∼9 km between breeding attempts. Our study provides the first comprehensive description of the patterns of within-season breeding dispersal in a grassland songbird. Our results reveal the remarkable prevalence of within-season movement in this system and the relatively large distances over which birds disperse. Such mobility has important implications for survey design and habitat management, as birds select habitat at much larger spatial scales than is generally appreciated. These results also provide foundational information for tests of alternative hypotheses explaining the ecological and evolutionary basis for such movements. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Late arrival on the breeding grounds has been associated with reduced fitness in migratory birds. Because migratory stopover accounts for the majority of time spent on migration, how individuals respond to both exogenous and endogenous factors associated with stopover will influence the pace of migration and arrival timing on the breeding grounds. Among the most important endogenous factors, body condition (i.e. fat stores) is expected to influence both movement behavior and departure decisions of individual migrants during stopover. In a novel experiment, we manipulated the condition of after-second-year (adult) male American Redstarts (Setophaga ruticilla) captured during spring migratory stopover and radio-tracked all individuals after release using a passive automated telemetry array and conventional hand tracking. After accounting for the positive effect of tailwind and capture date on departure probability, we demonstrated that body condition influenced both the movement behavior of individuals and stopover duration. Individual movement decreased throughout the stopover period at a rate of 0.7 km day-1, supporting the notion that birds progressively limit their movements as stopover progresses. However, treatment birds whose condition was experimentally reduced (i.e. food-restricted) exhibited ∼3.4 times greater daily movement rates, and control birds were 4 times more likely to depart on a given day than treatment birds. These results underscore the importance of energetic condition in mediating the movement and stopover dynamics of migratory birds. Further, despite their capacity to make behavioral adjustments, our results suggest migratory songbirds that experience decreases in body condition during migration (which could result from inclement weather or low-quality stopover habitat) are likely to be delayed in their arrival on the breeding grounds, which could lower reproductive performance and ultimately have population-level ramifications. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Given that population dynamics of birds are known to be sensitive to high fledgling mortality, a comprehensive understanding of the environmental factors that drive variation in fledgling survival is essential to avian conservation. We quantified multiple aspects of the Wood Thrush postfledging period using breeding and radio-telemetry data collected over the course of 4 breeding seasons in southern Indiana, USA. First, we examined how drought, forest cover, and brood parasitism affected nestling body condition and brood size. Second, after controlling for the age-specific increase in survival, we used multimodel inference to examine how brood parasitism, drought, forest cover, nestling body condition, and nest vegetation structure influenced postfledging survival. Finally, we measured the relationship between these covariates and fledgling movements. Drought decreased cumulative survival probabilities, with the youngest age group (<4 days postfledging) being most affected; however, this relationship was dependent on the amount of mature forest cover. During non-drought years, fledgling survival was lower in study plots with a high proportion of mature forest cover. By contrast, postfledging survival during a drought year was higher in study plots with a high proportion of forest cover. This drought year was also associated with lower nestling body condition and brood size, and with delayed postfledging dispersal from natal territories. Our results suggest that while Wood Thrush postfledging survival is relatively insensitive to both nest vegetation structure and brood parasitism, forest cover and breeding-season precipitation interact to affect multiple aspects of the species' postfledging period. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Understanding full annual cycle movements of long-distance migrants is essential for delineating populations, assessing connectivity, evaluating crossover effects between life stages, and informing management strategies for vulnerable or declining species. We used implanted satellite transmitters to track up to 2 years of annual cycle movements of 52 adult female White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca (Linnaeus, 1758)) captured in the eastern United States and Canada. We used these data to document annual cycle phenology; delineate migration routes; identify primary areas used during winter, stopover, breeding, and molt; and assess the strength of migratory connectivity and spatial population structure. Most White-winged Scoters wintered along the Atlantic coast from Nova Scotia to southern New England, with some on Lake Ontario. White-winged Scoters followed four migration routes to breeding areas from Quebec to the Northwest Territories. Principal postbreeding molting areas were in James Bay and the St. Lawrence River estuary. Migration phenology was synchronous regardless of winter or breeding origin. Cluster analyses delineated two primary breeding areas: one molting area and one wintering area. White-winged Scoters demonstrated overall weak to moderate connectivity among life stages, with molting to wintering connectivity the strongest. Thus, White-winged Scoters that winter in eastern North America appear to constitute a single continuous population. © 2018, Canadian Science Publishing. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The nesting ecology of the endangered Hawaiian Duck Anas wyvilliana was studied on Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i, USA between 2012 and 2014. Radio-telemetry and other nest-searching techniques (e.g. foot searches, chain drags) were used to locate and characterise nest sites, and to estimate clutch size and nest success. Nests were found in upland areas associated with a variety of land cover types, including forests, Taro Colocasia esculenta agriculture, managed wetlands, grasslands and scrub/shrub (n = 29). Topographic features associated with nest sites included dikes, upland flats, dry wetland basins and mountain ridges. Distance between nests and water ranged from 0.1–100 m (mean ± s.e. = 26.7 ± 7.3 m; n = 22). Mean height of vegetation at the nests was 103 ± 15 cm, and median overhead cover class was for 66–95% concealment (n = 21). Ground cover within 1 m of nests in forest and scrub/shrub habitat was dominated by Wedelia Sphagneticola trilobata, Uluhe Dicranopteris linearis, Barbas de Indio Andropogon bicornis and California Grass Urochloa mutica (n = 9). Dominant plant species around nests in Taro agriculture primarily included Wedelia, Shortleaf Spikesedge Kyllinga brevifolia and Nodeweed Synedrella nodiflora (n = 8); ground cover in grassland was dominated by Wedelia, California Grass and Guinea Grass Megathyrsus maximus (n = 3). Birds initiated 96% of nests during the eight-month period from October–May inclusive, with 52% occurring during February through April (n = 23). No re-nests were confirmed; however, one radio-tagged female nested three times within a 14-month period, with nest attempts (two successful, one failed) six and eight months apart. Mean clutch size was 5.8 ± 0.4 eggs (range = 4–9; n = 19), and clutch size was higher during the wet season (November–April; 6.1 + 0.4 eggs) than the dry season (May–October; 4.5 ± 0.3 eggs). Nest success was 0.387 (95% CI = 0.150–0.623; n = 20). Causes of nest failure included complete depredation (n = 1), flooding (n = 1), and abandonment due to partial depredation or unknown reasons (n = 6). ©Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust},

abstract={We analyzed banding (3259) and recovery (six years) data from a hunted population of greater sage-grouse Centrocercus urophasianus in northwestern Moffat County, Colorado to examine vulnerability to hunter harvests and annual survival of adult and hatch-year (juvenile) birds. Additionally, we combined the recovery data with hunter-harvested wings and applied the Lincoln estimator to provide unbiased estimates of tertiary sex-ratio. Our results yielded the following findings: Juveniles were harvested at twice the rate of adults, but harvest vulnerability was similar between adult males and females. Annual survival of juveniles was highly variable but similar between sexes. Sex ratios of adults and juveniles largely conformed to previously assumed proportions despite having adjusted those estimates with harvest rates. We suggest there is potential to effectively model populations of game birds using a combination of band recovery and hunter-harvested samples of species that can be readily captured, marked and have reasonable harvest rates. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Lead poisoning is an important conservation concern for wildlife, and scavenging birds are especially at risk from consumption of carcasses of animals killed with lead ammunition. Because current methods to identify lead exposure require animal capture and blood collection, management would benefit from the development of a less costly and noninvasive behavioral test for illness in wild animals. We attempted to design such a test to identify lead exposure in California condors (Gymnogyps californianus) that we tracked with global positioning system (GPS) telemetry in southern California, USA, 2013–2016. We measured blood-lead concentrations in tracked birds and expected that flight behavior would be influenced by lead exposure; thus, we measured the effect of blood-lead concentrations on 2 different types of movement rates and on the proportion of time condors spent in flight. We found no effect of lead exposure on any of these 3 behavioral metrics. Our work suggests that the measurements we took of flight behaviors were not a useful tool in predicting lead exposure in the mildly to moderately exposed birds we studied. Wild birds are effective at hiding illness, especially condors who have a strong social hierarchy in which showing weakness is a disadvantage. However, focusing on behaviors other than flight, expanding the sample studied to include birds with a wider range of lead concentration values, or analyzing tissues such as feathers (rather than, or in addition to, blood) may be more useful for identification of lead exposure and other diseases that may limit wildlife populations. © 2017 This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. © 2017 This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.},

abstract={Catching ground feeding birds has typically been accomplished through small, walk-in funnel-style traps. This approach is limited because it requires a bird to find its way into the trap, is biased toward less wary birds, and does not allow targeted trapping of individual birds. As part of a large study on Band-tailed Pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata) in New Mexico, we needed a trapping method that would allow more control over the number of birds we could trap at one time, when a trap was deployed, and target trapping of specific individuals. We adopted a relatively novel trapping technique used primarily for shorebirds, whoosh nets, to trap Band-tailed Pigeons at 3 different sites where birds were being fed by local landowners. During 2013-2015, whoosh nets were used to trap 702 Band-tailed Pigeons at 3 different locations in New Mexico. We captured 12.54 ± 8.19 pigeons per shot over 56 capture events across 3 locations (range: 2-39). Some superficial injuries occurred using this technique and typically involved damage to the primary and secondary wing coverts. In 2013, 24% of captured birds had an injury of this nature, but after modifying the net speed, injury rates in 2014 and 2015 dropped to 8% and 7%, respectively. Recaptured previously injured birds showed new feather growth within 2 weeks and showed no signs of injury after 4 weeks. Whoosh nets proved to be a highly effective solution for trapping large numbers of pigeons at baited sites. These systems are easily transported, quickly deployed, and easily adapted to a variety of site conditions. Received 5 May 2016. Accepted 6 March 2017. © 2018 Wilson Ornithological Society.

abstract={Detailed information about space use during the breeding season is limited for most Nearctic-Neotropical migratory species of songbirds because of their small size and often cryptic behaviors. We monitored male Cerulean Warblers (Setophaga cerulea), a species of conservation concern, using radio-telemetry during the 2006–2008 breeding seasons in northern Alabama to better understand their space use and habitat selection. We estimated diurnal home range and core areas using information theoretic criteria, located nocturnal roost sites, and related day and evening locations to surrounding landscape habitat, including features representative of canopy disturbances. Mean home range size was 6.7 ha (N = 10), and home ranges included an average of at least 2 core areas encompassing 0.7 ha. We located 53 nocturnal roost sites that were an average 159.0 m from the center of the nearest core area. More than one-third (36.6%) of roost sites were located outside the diurnal home ranges of male Cerulean Warblers; only 13.6% were located in core areas. Males in our study moved much farther than reported in previous studies, with some singing in areas > 300 m from previously used song perches, a behavior suggesting pursuit of extra-pair copulations. Cerulean Warblers in our study preferentially selected a heavily forested landscape composed of mesic, floodplain bottomlands with little man-made disturbance. Within their home ranges, diurnal locations of males in core areas were located significantly closer to a creek than locations outside of core areas. Our results suggest that male Cerulean Warblers require much larger areas than previously reported and underscore the importance of a predominately forested landscape in their habitat selection process. Although edge habitats appeared to influence space use by male Cerulean Warblers in our study, the extent to which this is an essential requirement is unclear. Our results and those of previous studies suggest that specific habitat requirements of this species can vary at the local scale throughout its breeding range. © 2018 Association of Field Ornithologists},

abstract={Birds encounter climate at the scale of microclimates that can vary rapidly in time and space and so understanding potential vulnerability and adaptations to those microclimates requires fine-scale measurements that accurately track thermal exposures. However, few options exist for recording the microclimates actually experienced by birds (realized microclimates). We constructed and tested a simple, low-cost, temperature logger for recording the realized microclimates of ground-nesting birds. We developed attachment protocols for band-mounting Thermochron iButtons on Ring-billed Gull (Larus delawarensis) chicks. We tested these mounted, temperature-logging devices on 20 chicks weighing > 200 g (device weight was 4 g), attaching devices for 48 h and observing behavior before and after attachment and removal. Devices recorded temperature immediately surrounding the leg at 2-min intervals. Recorded temperatures were strong predictors of observed thermoregulatory behaviors (panting and sitting), outperforming predictions based on air temperatures measured by basic, static approaches. Through comparison with matched controls (chicks with just a band), we detected no adverse physiological effects of devices, no effects on social or feeding behavior, and only a short-term decrease in inactivity immediately after device attachment (likely due to increased preening). By attaching iButtons to the legs of birds, we quantified realized thermal exposure, integrating air temperature, modes of environmental heat transfer, and bird behavior at microclimatic scales. Although not yet validated for broader use, our approach (including possible miniaturization) should be suitable to measure thermal exposure of adults, not just chicks, allowing collection of data concerning thermal exposures during flight under field conditions. At ~ $25 USD per device, our approach facilitates experimental protocols with robust sample sizes, even for relatively modest budgets. © 2018 Association of Field Ornithologists},

abstract={Radiotransmitters can be tail-mounted using cyanoacrylate glue and an accelerant rather than using a harness. Tail-mounted transmitters are dropped or shed when the rectrices molt, which may reduce transmitter effects while providing retention times sufficient for most research objectives. However, retention times of tail-mounted transmitters for birds are insufficiently described, and bias from not following all birds until transmitters are shed has been ignored. We studied transmitter retention of 106 birds of 6 species in the United States of America, 2010–2013, using direct observations and survival modeling based on radiotelemetry tracking. Cox proportional hazard survival models predicted median transmitter retention times from 4 to 53 days, depending on species. Our results suggest that researchers should anticipate premature (i.e., <30 days) tag loss rates from 15% to 38% for adult birds, and adjust permit and funding applications accordingly. However, predicted premature tag loss approached 100% for independent juvenile birds, which frequently appeared to disperse long distances, leading to few or no failure events to inform models. Overall, our results provide guidance for the design of future telemetry studies while demonstrating that tail-mounting transmitters can yield adequate data for a variety of research objectives. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={Several bat species occur in piñon (Pinus monophylla) and juniper (Juniperus ssp.) woodlands across the western United States, yet factors influencing roost site selection in these vegetation communities are poorly understood. Piñon-juniper woodlands have expanded beyond their historical geographic range in the western United States since European settlement. Many former stands of widely spaced old-growth juniper are now crowded with younger trees. Currently, federal and state land management agencies and private landowners are removing juniper trees to restore shrub-steppe for greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) across its geographic range, with little understanding of the treatment effects on roost site selection by bats. We used radio-telemetry to examine roost site selection of western long-eared myotis (Myotis evotis) at 3 spatial scales (roost, plot, and home range) during the breeding season. We attached radio-transmitters to 32 individuals and located 92 day roost sites for 25 different individuals. Lactating females selected rock crevices as roosts more frequently than tree cavities, whereas males used tree roosts and rock roosts more evenly. The majority of tree roosts were in pre-settlement trees that had at least 1 cavity. The odds that a tree was selected as a roost site increased with the number of available tree roosts within 17.8 m of the roost site. Preference by lactating females for rock roost sites increased with the number of available rock roosts within 5 m of the roost site and decreased with distance from water. Preference by males for rock roosts decreased if the roost was a single rock compared to an aggregate of rocks, increased with the number of available roosts within 5 m of the roost site, decreased with distance from water, and increased with area of pre-settlement juniper woodland within 1 km of the roost site. These results provide support for protecting pre-settlement juniper trees and rock formations near water sources in juniper woodlands to conserve existing populations of western long-eared myotis during the breeding season. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={Consideration of ecological scale is fundamental to understanding and managing avian population growth and decline. Empirically driven models for population dynamics and demographic processes across multiple spatial scales can be powerful tools to help guide conservation actions. Integrated population models (IPMs) provide a framework for better parameter estimation by unifying multiple sources of data (e.g., count and demographic data). Hierarchical structure within such models that include random effects allow for varying degrees of data sharing across different spatiotemporal scales. We developed an IPM to investigate Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) on the border of California and Nevada, known as the Bi-State Distinct Population Segment. Our analysis integrated 13 years of lek count data (n &gt; 2,000) and intensive telemetry (VHF and GPS; n &gt; 350 individuals) data across 6 subpopulations. Specifically, we identified the most parsimonious models among varying random effects and density-dependent terms for each population vital rate (e.g., nest survival). Using a joint likelihood process, we integrated the lek count data with the demographic models to estimate apparent abundance and refine vital rate parameter estimates. To investigate effects of climatic conditions, we extended the model to fit a precipitation covariate for instantaneous rate of change (r). At a metapopulation extent (i.e. Bi-State), annual population rate of change λ (er) did not favor an overall increasing or decreasing trend through the time series. However, annual changes in λ were driven by changes in precipitation (one-year lag effect). At subpopulation extents, we identified substantial variation in λ and demographic rates. One subpopulation clearly decoupled from the trend at the metapopulation extent and exhibited relatively high risk of extinction as a result of low egg fertility. These findings can inform localized, targeted management actions for specific areas, and status of the species for the larger Bi-State. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Band-tailed pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata) congregate at and use mineral sites (mineralized water or soil) throughout their range; however, information needed to interpret counts of pigeons at these sites and make inference to population abundance and distribution is lacking despite current monitoring efforts. Our objectives were to determine if we could create a mineral site used by band-tailed pigeons; test whether pigeons seek supplemental sodium, calcium, or both; describe the pattern of pigeon use of mineral sites seasonally and within days by individual birds; and evaluate implications of precipitation, fog, temperature, and mineral concentration on pigeon visitation patterns. We attracted hundreds of pigeons/day to a created mineral site that offered sodium, calcium, or both in a forested area in southwestern Washington, USA where we captured and applied passive integrated transponder (PIT) tags to 771 pigeons and monitored mineral use during 2010–2014. When offered paired sodium and calcium stations, pigeons near exclusively consumed sodium, and pigeons continued to use the created mineral site for 3 years when calcium was not available. Pigeons visited sodium stations on average once every 12 days during June through early October; reducing available sodium concentration from 3,500 ppm to 1,000 ppm had no significant effect on visitation rates. Counts of pigeons at mineral sites varied with precipitation, sex, and time of season; consequently, comparison of pigeon counts among mineral sites can be biased if not accounting for these factors. Our results show that pigeons can be attracted to mineral stations, and that counts at mineral sites and stations allow opportunities for population monitoring. Published 2017.

abstract={Conservation of small populations is often based on limited data from spatially and temporally restricted studies, resulting in management actions based on an incomplete assessment of the population drivers. If fluctuations in abundance are related to changes in weather, proper management is especially important, because extreme weather events could disproportionately affect population abundance. Conservation assessments, especially for vulnerable populations, are aided by a knowledge of how extreme events influence population status and trends. Although important for conservation efforts, data may be limited for small or vulnerable populations. Integrated population models maximize information from various sources of data to yield population estimates that fully incorporate uncertainty from multiple data sources while allowing for the explicit incorporation of environmental covariates of interest. Our goal was to assess the relative influence of population drivers for the Lesser Prairie-Chicken (Tympanuchus pallidicinctus) in the core of its range, western and southern Kansas, USA. We used data from roadside lek count surveys, nest monitoring surveys, and survival data from telemetry monitoring combined with climate (Palmer drought severity index) data in an integrated population model. Our results indicate that variability in population growth rate was most influenced by variability in juvenile survival. The Palmer drought severity index had no measurable direct effects on adult survival or mean number of offspring per female; however, there were declines in population growth rate following severe drought. Because declines in population growth rate occurred at a broad spatial scale, declines in response to drought were likely due to decreases in chick and juvenile survival rather than emigration outside of the study area. Overall, our model highlights the importance of accounting for environmental and demographic sources of variability, and provides a thorough method for simultaneously evaluating population demography in response to long-term climate effects. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Advances in telemetry and modeling of physical processes expand opportunities to assess relationships between marine predators and their dynamic habitat. The Columbia River plume (CRP) attracts sooty shearwaters Ardenna grisea and common murres Uria aalge, but how seabirds respond to variability in plume waters is unknown. We characterized seabird distributions in relation to hourly, daily, monthly, and seasonal variation in CRP location and surface area by attaching satellite telemetry tags to shearwaters in 2008 and 2009, and to murres in 2012 and 2013. We matched seabird locations to surface salinity from a high-resolution hydrodynamic model of the CRP and adjacent waters. Utilization distributions indicated high-use areas north of the Columbia River mouth and in continental shelf waters. Shearwater and murre occupancy of tidal (&lt;21 psu), recirculating (21-26 psu), and boundary (26-31 psu) plume waters was on average 31% greater than expected and positively correlated with CRP surface area. Seabird latitude was positively correlated with latitude of the geographic center of the CRP, indicating that birds move in phase with the plume. We detected a threshold response of seabirds to plume size, and birds were closer to the convergent CRP boundary (28 psu isohaline) after a surface area threshold between 1500 and 4000 km2 was exceeded. We conclude that shearwaters and murres selectively occupy and track plume waters, particularly dynamic boundary waters where foraging opportunities may be enhanced by increases in surface area and associated biophysical coupling that aggregates zooplankton and attracts prey fishes. © Inter-Research 2018.},

abstract={Wind power is a fast-growing energy resource, but wind turbines can kill volant wildlife, and the flight behavior of obligate soaring birds can place them at risk of collision with these structures. We analyzed altitudinal data from GPS telemetry of critically endangered California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus) to assess the circumstances under which their flight behavior may place them at risk from collision with wind turbines. Condor flight behavior was strongly influenced by topography and land cover, and birds flew at lower altitudes and closer to the rotor-swept zone of wind turbines when over ridgelines and steep slopes and over forested and grassland cover types. Condor flight behavior was temporally predictable, and birds flew lower and closer to the rotor-swept zone during early morning and evening hours and during the winter months, when thermal updrafts were weakest. Although condors only occasionally flew at altitudes that placed them in the rotor-swept zone of turbines, they regularly flew near or within wind resource areas preferred by energy developers. Practitioners aiming to mitigate collision risk to this and other soaring bird species of conservation concern can consider the manner in which flight behavior varies temporally and in response to areas of high topographic relief and proximity to nocturnal roosting sites. By contrast, collision risk to large soaring birds from turbines should be relatively lower over flatter and less rugged areas and in habitat used during daytime soaring. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={The impact of anthropogenic activities on breeding bird populations are typically assessed using nest success despite the importance of the postfledging period and juvenile survival for the population dynamics of many birds. Using a combination of radio telemetry data collected between 2012 and 2014, and long-term monitoring data collected between 2005 and 2016, we evaluated whether postfledging survival of Yellow Warblers (Setophaga petechia) is affected when their riparian nesting habitat becomes inundated by the Upper Arrow Lakes Reservoir in the Columbia River Valley near Revelstoke, British Columbia, Canada. Thirty-eight percent of radio-tagged fledglings (n = 26) survived for at least 21 days after leaving the nest. Radio-tagged birds that fledged from nests in territories that were inundated by water tended to be have lower survival than those that fledged from nests in territories that were not inundated by water. Local recruitment was low (6.4%, n = 438). Local recruitment was nevertheless positively affected by nestling condition prior to fledging. Fledglings from territories that were not inundated by water also tended to be more likely to recruit locally than those that fledged from territories that were inundated by water. In both cases, we estimated that reservoir operations that flooded habitat reduced postfledging survival or local recruitment by approximately 50%. Our study emphasizes the importance of considering the postfledging period when developing mitigation measures or management plans aimed at minimizing the impact of anthropogenic activities on bird populations. © 2018 by the author(s).},

abstract={Documenting local space use of birds that move rapidly, but are too small to carry GPS tags, such as swallows and swifts, can be challenging. For these species, tracking methods such as manual radio-telemetry and visual observation are either inadequate or labor- and time-intensive. Another option is use of an automated telemetry system, but equipment for such systems can be costly when many receivers are used. Our objective, therefore, was to determine if an automated radio-telemetry system, consisting of just two receivers, could provide an alternative to manual tracking for gathering data on local space use of six individuals of three species of aerial insectivores, including one Cliff Swallow (Petrochelidon pyrrhonota), one Eastern Phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), and four Barn Swallows (Hirundo rustica). We established automated radio-telemetry systems at three sites near the city of Peterborough in eastern Ontario, Canada, from May to August 2015. We evaluated the location error of our two-receiver system using data from moving and stationary test transmitters at known locations, and used telemetry data from the aerial insectivores as a test of the system's ability to track rapidly moving birds under field conditions. Median location error was ~250 m for automated telemetry test locations after filtering. More than 90% of estimated locations had large location errors and were removed from analysis, including all locations > 1 km from receiver stations. Our automated telemetry receivers recorded 17,634 detections of the six radio-tagged birds. However, filtering removed an average of 89% of bird location estimates, leaving only the Cliff Swallow with enough locations for analysis of space use. Our results demonstrate that a minimal automated radio-telemetry system can be used to assess local space use by small, highly mobile birds, but the resolution of the data collected using only two receiver stations was coarse and had a limited range. To improve both location accuracy and increase the percentage of usable location estimates collected, we suggest that, in future studies, investigators use receivers that simultaneously record signals detected by all antennas, and use of a minimum of three receiver stations with more antennas at each station. © 2018 Association of Field Ornithologists},

abstract={Many birds that breed in mature forest are known to use early successional habitat to some extent during the postfledging period, but the degree of roosting use remains unclear for most species. In fact, for Neotropical migrant passerines, roosting ecology on the breeding grounds is largely undescribed. To determine female Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorum) breeding status, clearcut utilization, and roosting habitat during the breeding season, we attached radio transmitters to 19 female Worm-eating Warblers with fully developed brood patches caught in 8 year old clearcuts from 1 to 15 June 2016. Of the 19 radio-tagged females, 11 were found with dependent fledglings by 17 June: 5 individuals were considered to be independent (i.e., foraging and moving through the landscape without fledglings) and 6 (3 with fledglings and 3 without) to be transitory (i.e., located <5 times before the signal was lost). Nest-searching and telemetry data suggest that the postfledging period may have started by 28 May 2016 for some Worm-eating Warblers. Overall habitat use of radio-tagged female Worm-eating Warblers differed, with 2 individuals associated with clearcut habitat, 3 associated with mature forest habitat, and 8 showing variable use of edge/both habitat classes. We recorded 116 different roost locations for 18 radio-tagged females in clearcut, mature forest, and edge habitats (55, 42, and 19 locations, respectively). Overall habitat preference differed among individuals, but our study suggests that early successional young forest habitat may serve an important role in Worm-eating Warbler roosting and postfledging ecology. © 2018 Wilson Ornithological Society.

abstract={A fundamental assumption of avian survival analysis is that the act of capture, handling, and marking birds does not affect subsequent survival. This assumption is violated when animals experience injury, physiological stress, or disorientation during capture and handling that increases their mortality risk following release. Such capture-related effects must be accounted for during analysis, typically by censoring individuals from the survival history, to avoid biasing the resulting survival estimates. We reviewed studies of radio-marked upland game birds to characterize researcher approaches for addressing short-term effects of capture on survival, and used data from a study of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) to illustrate an empirical approach for evaluating such effects and identifying time thresholds to censor individuals that die shortly following release. A majority of studies (65%) reported using some form of censoring for mortality that occurred within one to three weeks after release, although only 8% of studies reported an empirical approach to identify a threshold for censorship. We found that Ruffed Grouse mortality was greater from one to six days following release when compared with 7 to 30 days. This threshold, and the proportion of birds censored as a result of it, is consistent with a number of previous studies of radio-marked Ruffed Grouse. We also found that short-term mortality of Ruffed Grouse following release was reduced by checking traps twice each day and by adequately concealing traps. We recommend that future studies of radio-marked birds employ empirical methods for detecting postrelease mortality thresholds, which will allow for reduced bias while minimizing unnecessary censorship of birds that die for reasons unrelated to capture. © 2018 by the author(s).},

abstract={For migratory waterbirds, the availability and quality of suitable stopover habitat can affect body condition and demographic parameters throughout the annual cycle. This study investigates the importance of the Salton Sea, a large saline lake located in the southwestern United States near the USA-Mexico border, for migrating Caspian Terns (Hydroprogne caspia) fitted with long-duration satellite telemetry tags in the northwest contiguous USA. During fall migration, 100% (n = 25) in 2014 and 98% (n = 63) in 2015 of all tagged individuals were tracked to the Salton Sea, with median durations of stay lasting 36 and 25 days, respectively. Use of the Salton Sea during subsequent spring migrations was less consistent than in fall, but still substantial, with 91% (n = 23) and 68% (n = 53) of all birds conducting brief stops there during 2015 and 2016, respectively. The future of the Salton Sea as suitable habitat for fish and piscivorous birds is uncertain due to rising salinity levels caused by reduced input flows. It is also uncertain if other wetlands in the region can serve as replacement habitat for Caspian Terns and other migratory piscivorous species should the Salton Sea cease to provide fish prey. © 2018 The Waterbird Society.

abstract={Satellite telemetry is widely used to generate information on species' use of space, which contributes to meeting conservation goals. Between June 2015 and September 2016, we obtained approximately 11,000 GPS points from two adult male Andean Condors (Vultur gryphus) that had been fitted with satellite transmitters and released in the central Andes of Peru. We used GPS coordinates and associated data to produce habitat distribution models (binomial Generalized Linear Models) from presence and pseudo-absence data of roosting sites and foraging areas visited by these individuals. The best potential habitats for Andean Condors in Peru were west of the Andes, from the border with Ecuador, south to Bolivia and Chile. Foraging areas of both individuals were at higher elevations than roosting sites (means: 3934 masl and 3356 masl, respectively). Roosting sites were in areas dominated by grasslands and agriculture, whereas foraging areas were dominated by puna grassland and brush. Conservation strategies for Andean Condors in Peru should be informed by data derived from satellite telemetry and should focus on preserving natural short vegetation above 3000 m west of the Andes for foraging and, for roosting sites, on maintaining areas free from the disturbances of road construction. © 2018 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Geolocator technology has recently demonstrated that many songbird species exhibit prolonged stopovers during migration that may be analogous to the staging behavior typically attributed to shorebirds. Although staging areas can act as ecological bottlenecks, there is little information on how or why songbirds engage in prolonged stopover and whether this behavior differs among individuals. We used automated radio telemetry along the eastern coastline of North America to compare stopover and migration behavior of Blackpoll Warblers (Setophaga striata) and Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus), species that differ markedly in migratory strategy during fall migration. We also tested whether migratory behaviors differed within each species by capture date or breeding origin. Prolonged stopover was more common and longer for Blackpoll Warblers, which suggests that it may be a particularly adaptive behavior for supporting the transatlantic endurance flights they make from the region. Both species made prolonged stopovers that consisted of extended stops at one site, as well as multiple shorter stops within a geographically broad stopover landscape. Later migrants of both species and Blackpoll Warblers from more northwestern origins exhibited migratory traits consistent with a time-minimization strategy. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Migratory birds spend most of their journeys at stopover sites where they rest and refuel. Many migrants are in steep decline, and understanding their behavior within and among migrations is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies across the full annual cycle. One of the most rapidly declining songbirds in North America is the Rusty Blackbird (Euphagus carolinus; 85-95% decline over the past 50 yr), and stopover ecology is a major gap in our knowledge of its annual cycle. We utilized an automated telemetry array in western Lake Erie and the Motus Wildlife Tracking System to track landscape-scale movements, stopover duration, departure behavior, and between-season site fidelity in this species. We found that stopover duration during both fall and spring was nearly 1 mo (mean = 25.5 days)-exceptionally long for a passerine. During spring, birds in both poor condition and high degree of molt had longer stopovers, post-departure flights were relatively long for a songbird, and tailwinds predicted departure in both seasons. Many individuals made landscape-scale (10-35 km) relocations during stopover. Site fidelity was high for a passerine, in terms of both route and stopover site. Taken together, these behaviors describe a migration strategy that largely matches the staging behavior of shorebirds. Lastly, we found that Rusty Blackbirds migrate directly across Lake Erie and migrate primarily at night, which might expose them to mortality from offshore wind development. Collectively, our results indicate that high-quality stopover habitat may be critically important to Rusty Blackbird populations. More broadly, our results highlight the need to expand the scale of stopover studies, and to further explore all aspects of species' annual cycles to understand potential limiting factors on populations. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Animals often exhibit changes in their behaviour during migration. Telemetry data provide a way to observe geographic position of animals over time, but not necessarily changes in the dynamics of the movement process. Continuous-time models allow for statistical predictions of the trajectory in the presence of measurement error and during periods when the telemetry device did not record the animal's position. However, continuous-time models capable of mimicking realistic trajectories with sufficient detail are computationally challenging to fit to large datasets. Furthermore, basic continuous-time model specifications (e.g. Brownian motion) lack realism in their ability to capture nonstationary dynamics. We present a unified class of animal movement models that are computationally efficient and provide a suite of approaches for accommodating nonstationarity in continuous trajectories due to migration and interactions among individuals. Our approach uses process convolutions to allow for flexibility in the movement process while facilitating implementation and incorporating location uncertainty. We show how to nest convolution models to incorporate interactions among migrating individuals to account for nonstationarity and provide inference about dynamic migratory networks. We demonstrate these approaches in two case studies involving migratory birds. Specifically, we used process convolution models with temporal deformation to account for heterogeneity in individual greater white-fronted goose migrations in Europe and Iceland, and we used nested process convolutions to model dynamic migratory networks in sandhill cranes in North America. The approach we present accounts for various forms of temporal heterogeneity in animal movement and is not limited to migratory applications. Furthermore, our models rely on well-established principles for modelling-dependent data and leverage modern approaches for modelling dynamic networks to help explain animal movement and social interaction. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Prey species must consistently balance the need for resource acquisition with the threat of predation. This balance is particularly true for gallinaceous birds, such as the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), which are ground foragers and are often exposed to increased predation risk compared to arboreal foragers. We studied how bobwhites might mitigate the threat of human hunting pressure by altering their foraging strategy. We directly monitored hunting encounters with bobwhites, during October 2014–March 2015, and collected daily movement paths (n = 514) using radio-telemetry. We performed first-passage time analysis to infer foraging behavior by calculating bout frequency, area, duration, and timing. We found bobwhites mitigated exposure to human hunters by increasing foraging frequency coupled with a decrease in duration (15.4%) and area (7.1%) in response to hunting pressure. We observed a temporal shift in foraging away from peak hunting hours by 30 minutes when birds were recently exposed to a discharged firearm. Our results imply that hunting game species can disrupt timing of foraging and therefore influence allocation to competing activities such as anti-predator vigilance. We propose implementing a dynamic harvest management regime that distributes hunting activity temporally and spatially to mitigate high hunting pressure and reduce behavioral effects on bobwhites. Careful planning of hunting activity should reduce its additive effects on natural mortality while improving hunter satisfaction. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={Anti-predator behavior can be costly to prey species and the consequences of these decisions may affect survival. Interactions between humans and hunted species can lead to behavioral shifts in the animal that affect hunter satisfaction and possibly fitness of the animals. We assessed the influence of multiple factors that may affect anti-predator behavior in a commonly harvested game bird, the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), during October 2013–March 2015 on a private plantation in South Carolina, USA. We monitored bobwhite-hunter interactions during hunting events (n = 40) using radio-telemetry and behavioral observations. We investigated bobwhite anti-predator behavior in 2 contexts, choice of evasive tactic and timing of tactic deployment (i.e., level of wariness), using a combination of linear regression and multinomial models in a Bayesian framework. Our results indicate the approach style of the hunter (i.e., pointing dog) and vegetation density affect the evasive tactic used. Dense vegetation at 0.6 m above ground height promoted hiding behavior of bobwhites, whereas approaching pointing dogs (i.e., not holding point) promoted flushing. Also, dense vegetation at 0.3 m above ground height and previous exposure to a discharged firearm elicited an earlier anti-predator response. Our results imply that bobwhites make context-specific decisions regarding hunter evasion, which may be a result of associative learning. Managers may be able to increase bobwhite-hunter encounters and improve hunter satisfaction by maintaining vegetation structure between 0.6 and 1.3 m to promote hiding behavior throughout the hunting season. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

Investigations of this trade-off in birds have focused primarily on costs of rearing altricial young, because such costs are assumed to be low in species with precocial young. We experimentally manipulated nest success to test for a trade-off between (1) raising offspring for up to 1 yr after successfully nesting and (2) survival in female Ross's Geese (Chen rossii), a species with self-feeding, precocial young. We used multistate capture-resighting analysis that also incorporated recoveries of dead birds for inference about survival. We detected a general negative effect of successful nesting on survival, whereby point estimates of annual survival for successfully nesting females were consistently lower than those for failed nesters. Failed nesters had a greater proportion of mortality attributable to hunting, judging from their higher rates of reported mortality by hunters compared to successful nesters; thus, a cost of breeding associated with successful nesting likely resulted from natural mortality factors during incubation and brood rearing, and not from exploitation by humans. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Understanding population dynamics is central to population management, particularly for game species that experience human harvest and non-harvest mortality. Ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus) are a widely distributed and common game species in North America that have experienced population declines along their southern range margins, including portions of New England, primarily in response to forest succession and habitat loss. In the state of Maine, ruffed grouse are generally considered abundant, but there is a lack of state-specific knowledge of ruffed grouse survival and harvest rates to inform harvest management. We estimated seasonal and annual survival rates, harvest rates, and documented cause-specific mortality of 248 radio-marked ruffed grouse at 2 study areas in central Maine from 2014 to 2016. We used Program MARK to evaluate sources of spatial, temporal, and individual variation that may affect ruffed grouse survival and harvest. Survival was lowest during October and during winter, and adult ruffed grouse had a higher survival probability than juveniles throughout the year with mean annual survival probabilities of 0.28 ± 0.01 (SE) and 0.13 ± 0.003, respectively. Harvest rates were greater in a state-owned Wildlife Management Area and were lower within commercially managed private forest that was open to public hunting. Harvest results suggest harvest (H) was greatest at the beginning of the hunting season (Oct; Frye Mountain HOct = 0.14 ± 0.02; Stud Mill HOct = 0.07 ± 0.02), and was lower later in the season (Nov and Dec; Frye Mountain HNov-Dec = 0.07 ± 0.02; Stud Mill HNov-Dec = 0.03 ± 0.01). Pooled across all years and study areas, the ruffed grouse harvest rate was 0.16 (95% CI = 0.14–0.18). Our results are comparable to other range-wide studies and suggest that current hunting regulations for ruffed grouse in Maine are consistent with sustainable population management. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={Avian radar technologies have the potential to serve an important role in the quantification of bird movements and determining patterns of bird use in areas where human–wildlife conflicts might occur (e.g., airports, wind-energy facilities). However, capabilities and limitations of these technologies are relatively unknown and ground-truthing studies are needed to help wildlife managers understand the biological meaning of radar information. We evaluated the efficacy of 3 X-band marine radar sensors for tracking birds and flocks of birds observed on the airfield at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, USA, during March 2011–November 2012. We used specific information regarding field observations of birds or flocks to determine how frequently the 3 radar sensors provided corresponding tracks of these avian targets. In addition, we examined various factors to determine if they had any influence on the frequency of correspondence between visual observations and radar tracks. Of the 972 sightings of individual birds (49%) or flocks of birds (51%) by observers on the airfield that had the potential to be observed by the radar, 143 (15%) were tracked by ≥1 radar sensor. All confirmed tracks of individual birds or flocks were ≤4.8 km from these radars. Among the 3 radar sensors, larger bodied bird species, bird/flocks flying at higher altitudes, and bird/flocks closer to the radars increased the ability of those units to track avian targets. This study provides new information regarding the performance of radar systems for tracking birds on the airfield of one of the largest and busiest airports in the world. Published 2018.

abstract={Satellite telemetry is a powerful tool used to follow animals through their annual life cycle, informing the understanding of behavior and distribution of many species. Because boreal- and arctic-nesting North American sea duck populations are challenging to survey, satellite telemetry is important for describing breeding distributions and identifying breeding population structure. Accurate knowledge of breeding distributions is needed for effective habitat and harvest management, but satellite telemetry is expensive so it is important to consider the effort necessary to accurately map breeding distributions. We construct 3 theoretical breeding distributions using existing telemetry data from 3 species of sea ducks, Barrow's goldeneye (Bucephala islandica), surf scoter (Melanitta perspicillata), and black scoter (M. americana), by fitting kernel densities to approximate breeding locations of individual birds. Then we determined the minimum sample size needed to approximate these theoretical breeding distributions by assessing the overlap between breeding densities simulated by sampling from the distributions and the theoretical breeding densities. Diminishing information gains with additional effort (i.e., <1–5% improvement in prediction) were reached with sample sizes ranging from 80 to 130. Sea duck mortality, transmitter failure, and exclusion of non-breeding individuals resulted in an effective sample size smaller than the number of birds originally marked. For the cases we considered, obtaining breeding locations for 80–130 individuals would require marking 11–41% more birds than the sample size goal. Thus, although satellite telemetry provides valuable information on sea duck populations, our analysis suggests that accurately estimating the extent and relative use of breeding habitats requires substantial investment. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

Better understanding of the processes affecting age- and year-specific capture probabilities is needed to advance the application of constant-effort mist-netting for monitoring and conservation, particularly in many tropical settings where capture rates are often low. We ranked members of the avian community by capture frequencies, determined if temporary emigration influenced the availability of birds to be captured, and assessed the distribution of birds relative to mist-nets and the parity between capture-based productivity estimates and number of fledglings in nest plots in a tropical dry forest in Puerto Rico in 2009 and 2010. Few captures characterized the community of 25 resident species and, when estimable, capture probabilities were low, particularly for juveniles (typically < 0.1). Negative trends in capture probability, temporary emigration, and the distribution of birds suggest that avoidance of mist-nets influenced capture rates in our study. Increasing mist-net coverage or moving mist-nets between sampling periods could increase capture rates. The number of fledglings observed in nest plots (25 ha/plot) did not correlate well with capture-derived estimates (20 ha/net stations), suggesting the presence of immigrants or failure to find all nests. Our results suggest that indices of breeding productivity from mist-netting data may track temporal changes in productivity, but such data likely do not reflect “true” productivity in most cases unless age-specific differences in capture probability are incorporated into estimates. Pilot studies should be conducted to evaluate capture rates and the spatial extent sampled by mist-nets to improve sampling design and inferences before informing decisions. © 2018 Association of Field Ornithologists},

abstract={During migration, birds require stopover habitat to rest and refuel before resuming flight. While long-distance migratory flights represent a large energy investment, stopover accounts for roughly two-thirds of a bird's total energy expenditure during migration. Therefore, birds should minimize energy expenditure while also minimizing time and predation risk during stopover. To understand activity during migration, we recorded activity patterns (i.e. fine-scale movements associated with a range of behaviors) of 3 species, Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus), Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), and Wood Thrush (Hylocichla mustelina), at a stopover site along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico during autumn migration using automated radio telemetry. We found Red-eyed Vireos to be the most active and Swainson's Thrushes the least active. For each species, we used boosted regression trees to investigate associations between activity and factors known to influence bird behavior during stopover. While species differed, day of year and temperature were important predictors of activity for all species. Vireos were active early in the season, under light winds and warmer temperatures, and on evenings when winds were more favorable. Thrushes were more active as the season progressed and when temperatures were cooler. Thrush activity also differed between years, although thrushes increased activity later in the season during all years. Our results illustrate automated radio telemetry as a unique and valuable tool for understanding fine-scale behaviors of birds during stopover. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Partial migration-a strategy in which some individuals are resident and others are migratory within the same population-is widespread among avian species and could play an important transitional role in the evolution of migratory behavior. Nevertheless, detailed movement data are unavailable for most partial migrant species. We examined migration strategies of the American Crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), a partially migratory species that overwinters in large communal roosts, from which some birds migrate north to breed. We used a combination of satellite telemetry, isotopic signatures (δ2H), and molecular markers (33 microsatellites) to describe and characterize the migratory movements of individuals from overwintering roosts on the east coast (Utica, New York) and west coast (Davis, California) of the United States. We collected 11,951 data points from 18 satellite-tagged individuals between 2014 and 2018, among which 14 (77.8%) were migratory (8 of 11 and 6 of 7 birds on the west and east coasts, respectively). Migration distances were 280-1,095 km and 177-793 km on the west and east coasts, respectively. Individual birds were consistent in their migratory behavior across years, and breeding-site fidelity was high: Both migratory and resident birds returned to the same location in the breeding season of each year. Both isotopic signatures and molecular markers could generally differentiate residents from long-distance migrants (i.e. those breeding at latitudes &gt;3.5°N of the resident populations), but they did not consistently differentiate residents from migrants with shorter migration distances. Overall, these data on the migratory movements of American Crows and the proportion of migrants in their roosts can serve as a baseline against which to test predictions about how partial migrants will respond to environmental alterations such as climate change and urbanization. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={In 2007, the first miniature light-level geolocators were deployed on small landbirds, revolutionizing the study of migration. In this paper, we review studies that have used geolocators to track small landbirds with the goal of summarizing research themes and identifying remaining important gaps in understanding. We also highlight research and opportunities using 2 recently developed tracking technologies: archival GPS tags and automated radio-telemetry systems. In our review, we found that most (54%) geolocator studies focused on quantifying natural history of migration, such as identifying migration routes, nonbreeding range, and migration timing. Studies of behavioral ecology (20%) uncovered proximate drivers of movements, including en route habitat quality; that migration routes, but not timing, may be flexible in some species; and different age and sex classes show significant differences in migration strategy. Studies of the evolution of migration (9%) have illustrated that migration is a potential barrier to hybridizing species or subspecies, and some work has correlated gene polymorphisms and methylation patterns with migration behavior. Studies of migratory connectivity (11%) have shown that a moderate level of connectivity is common, although variability across and within species exists. Studies of seasonal interactions (7%) have found mixed results: in some cases, carryover effects have been identified; in other cases, carryover effects are buffered during intervening stages of the annual cycle. Archival GPS tags provide unprecedented precision in locations of nonbreeding sites and migration routes, and will continue to improve understanding of migration across large spatial scales. Automated radio-telemetry systems are revolutionizing our knowledge of migratory stopover biology, and have led to discoveries of previously unknown stopover behaviors. Together, these tracking technologies will continue to provide insight into small migratory landbird movements and contribute important information for conservation of this rapidly declining group. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Theory suggests that animals should select resources on the basis of perceived fitness benefits, and avoid other available resources that may result in fitness costs. However, resource selection is both a scale- A nd a life-stage-specific process, in which the importance of different resources may vary among spatial scales of selection and phases of species' life cycles. We investigated multilevel resource selection and summer survival of Ruffed Grouse (Bonasa umbellus) in Maine, USA, to understand life-stage-specific resource selection and the cost of brood rearing. At the landscape level, male Ruffed Grouse selected areas with greater densities of woody stems taller than breast height, while females avoided these areas and selected areas with greater ground coverage by Rubus. Males further selected areas with greater stem densities at the local level, while females again avoided areas with greater stem densities and selected locally available areas with greater ground coverage by Rubus. Weekly survival rates (± SE) were reduced for females that were actively tending broods (S = 0.9393 ± 0.0294) when compared with nonreproductive individuals (both males and nonbrooded females; S = 0.9966 ± 0.0034). These differences in survival based on reproductive status were better supported than a difference associated solely with sex and resulted in a 69% chance that a female would survive raising a brood to 6 wk, compared with a 98% chance of survival for nonreproductive birds over the same 6 wk period. Our results suggest that male Ruffed Grouse selected resources that reduced their mortality risk, thereby investing in survival and their future reproductive potential, whereas brood-rearing females selected resources to benefit current reproduction and incurred a cost to their own survival in the process. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={Tag-recovery data from organisms captured and marked post breeding are commonly used to estimate juvenile and adult survival. If annual fecundity could also be estimated, tagging studies such as European and North American bird-ringing schemes could provide all parameters needed to estimate population growth. I modified existing tag-recovery models to allow estimation of annual fecundity using age composition and recapture probabilities obtained during routine banding operations of northern pintails (Anas acuta) and dark-eyed juncos (Junco hyemalis), and I conducted simulations to assess estimator performance in relation to sample size. For pintails, population growth rate from band-recovery data (λ = 0.93, SD: 0.06) was similar but less precise than count-based estimates from the Waterfowl Breeding Pair and Habitat Survey (λ: 0.945, SE: 0.001). Models with temporal variation in vital rates indicated that annual population growth in pintails was driven primarily by variation in fecundity. Juncos had lower survival but greater fecundity, and their estimated population growth rate (λ: 1.01, SD: 0.19) was consistent with count-based surveys (λ: 0.986). Simulations indicated that reliable (CV < 0.10) estimates of fecundity could be obtained with >1,000 within-season live encounters. Although precision of survival estimates depended primarily on numbers of adult recoveries, estimates of fecundity and population growth were most sensitive to total number of live encounters. Synthesis and applications: Large-scale ring-recovery programs could be used to estimate annual fecundity in many species of birds, but the approach requires better data curation, including accurate assessment of age, better reporting of banding totals, and greater emphasis on obtaining and reporting within-season live encounters. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Indices of abundance, such as point counts, commonly are used to monitor trends in bird populations. In some circumstances, however, an index of abundance provides insufficient information for making management decisions and accurate density estimates are necessary. Wild ring-necked pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) were translocated to 10 study areas in Pennsylvania from 2007 to 2014 with the goal of establishing female densities of 3.86 pheasants/km2. We developed a population density estimator that used 3-minute crowing counts adjusted for probability of detection to estimate male pheasant density and flushing surveys to estimate the female:male ratio. To account for detection probability, we estimated the probability a pheasant was available to be detected by monitoring crowing frequency of male pheasants fitted with radio-transmitters and the probability an observer was able to detect a crowing pheasant at distances from 0 to 0.93 km. We found the probability a pheasant crowed during 3 minutes decreased linearly over our survey period from 0.66 in mid-April to 0.46 by the end of May. At the farthest distance we were able to accurately detect a crowing pheasant. We estimated the probability of detecting a pheasant at 0.80 km to be 0.019 ± 0.005 (SE), which means that we could not assume any fixed distance beyond which crowing birds could not be detected. Therefore, we replaced the probability of detection in the standard distance sampling estimator with the effective area of detection. The estimation of the effective area of detection is robust to choice of radius of the point and did not require observers to estimate the distance to crowing pheasants. We estimated the female:male ratio to be 1.02:1, despite the ratio of released pheasants being 4.46:1. Only 1 study area achieved the female density goal ((Formula presented.) = 4.16); the maximum density at all other study areas was &lt;2 females/km2. The estimator we developed incorporated multiple detection probabilities to provide density estimates and simplified the crowing count protocol by eliminating the need for observers to estimate their distance from a detected bird, which makes the estimator useful for estimation of population abundance when explicit population density objectives must be evaluated. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={The most direct effects of wind energy development on birds are rotor blade strikes and collisions with wind turbines. Probability of a blade strike is affected by the rates at which a bird visits the rotor swept zone (RSZ), and mitigated by the behaviors it uses to avoid being struck. Between 2011 and 2013, we studied the occurrence and nature of avoidance responses of 3 nesting ferruginous hawks (Buteo regalis), 5 Swainson's hawks (B. swainsoni), and 2 red-tailed hawks (B. jamaicensis) to turbines built within their territories. Two of 10 breeding males we tracked with satellite telemetry were turbine-collision fatalities, one during the study and the other in the following year. Collectively, nesting hawks displayed no macro-avoidance of turbine projects and flew adjacent to or within RSZs at high rates ((Formula presented.) = 0.8 visits/hr, 1.3 min/visit; n = 387 visits during 434 hr of observation) synchronized with morning and afternoon peaks in foraging activity. Passes through rotors accounted for 9.8% of responses. The turbine that hawks approached most closely from collective encounters on each territory accounted for an average of 29% of all visits to RSZs and visitation was greater than expected at turbines <0.8 km from nests (P < 0.001). As rotor speed increased, the frequency that hawks in RSZs flew between turbine rows increased relative to other avoidance behaviors and hawks that were potentially distracted (i.e., hunting or aggressive chasing) increased avoidance flights over and between turbines. The ability of hawks to employ evasive behaviors mitigated blade collision but allowed for close, hourly interaction with turbines that increased risk of collision. Where nesting populations of hawks are at risk, particularly ferruginous hawks, pre-construction siting of wind turbines needs to account for nest locations and expected high rates of hawk visitation to turbines <800 m from nests. On existing projects collision risk can be reduced through operational shutdown of turbines in this zone during 2 daily peaks in hawk foraging in the vicinity where hawks nest, but a greater effectiveness can be achieved by shutdown of specific turbines associated with highest regular use. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={Since the initial development of the robust design, this capture-recapture model structure has been modified to estimate temporary emigration and expanded to include auxiliary information such as band recovery and live resight data using maximum likelihood approaches. These developments have allowed investigators to separately assess individual and group effects on true survival, site fidelity, and temporary emigration. Additionally, recent advances in the BUGS language have allowed researchers to develop increasingly complex, user-specified models in Bayesian frameworks. The robust design has rarely been implemented in the BUGS language, and previous attempts to parameterize the robust design in BUGS exhibited strong bias in estimates of temporary emigration rates. Given the limitations of current parameterizations of the robust design in Bayesian frameworks, and our research objectives, we have developed a parameterization of the robust design in the BUGS language that produces unbiased estimates of all model parameters. We use this novel model structure to examine lifetime carry-over effects of environmental conditions during early life on annual breeding probabilities of Pacific black brent Branta bernicla nigricans breeding on the Yukon–Kuskokwim River Delta in Western Alaska. We found that individuals that were more structurally developed as goslings bred at increased rates as adults (β = 0.14, f = 0.94), with no effect on adult survival (β = 0.01, f = 0.62). Additionally, we provide evidence for long-term declines in apparent survival of breeding adult females at the population level (β = −0.01, f = 0.90). This novel model structure can be easily expanded (Gibson et al., in press) and has important implications for population modelling at broad scales, where we apply it to a declining population of Pacific black brent. Given long-term declines in gosling growth on the Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, we predict future declines in population trajectories as a result of lifetime carry-over effects of environmental conditions during growth on adult fecundity and long-term declines in adult survival. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Fire disturbance in tropical savannas is integral to maintaining habitat heterogeneity and biodiversity, but its impact on avian species is highly variable. Savannas in northern Australia have recently been invaded by gamba grass (Andropogon gayanus), a perennial tussock grass that fuels late season fires at eight times the intensity of native vegetation. As gamba grass rapidly outcompetes native species and promotes more frequent and intense fires, it greatly decreases landscape heterogeneity and alters the effect of fire in tropical savannas. To investigate how a small passerine, the red-backed fairywren (Malurus melanocephalus), responds to fire disturbance and gamba grass cover, we studied their fine-scale habitat use throughout the dry season before and after a high intensity fire. We used two spatially distinct approaches, radio-telemetry and a transect-based population census, to quantify fairywren habitat use at the group and population level, respectively. Radio-telemetry and transect surveys revealed no direct mortality associated with the severe bushfire during the middle of the study season, suggesting fairywrens are resilient in the short-term to fire disturbance. Our results indicate that fairywrens are largely flexible in their habitat use – instead of relocating after fire, they re-centre their home range around the most photosynthetically productive habitats, dominated by saplings. While we found substantial variation in habitat use among social groups, red-backed fairywren groups generally avoided dense habitat areas dominated by mature gamba grass. We conclude that red-backed fairywrens are resilient to fire and flexible in their habitat use in the short-term; however, in the long-term, gamba grass may pose a threat to population viability. The importance of flexible behavioural strategies in tropical passerines will increase as fire regimes are exacerbated by invasive species and climate change. © 2018 Ecological Society of Australia},

abstract={Aim: To assess the efficacy of marine reserves in Australia for shy albatross, using long-term tracking data. Location: Albatross Island, Tasmania, and south Australian waters. Methods: We integrated a tracking dataset consisting of 111 individuals collected over 23 years and generated Brownian bridge kernel density estimations to identify important habitat. We quantified the overlap between the foraging distribution of early incubating adults and post-fledgling juveniles with management boundaries and marine reserves. We compared the extent of coverage of albatross foraging areas by Marine Protection Areas (MPAs) relative to a randomly designed network of the same size to determine whether the spatial protection measures are likely to be effective. Results: Incubating adults consistently foraged in waters to the northwest of Tasmania while post-fledglings occupied shelf waters around Tasmania and South Australia. We show that our sample of 99 incubating adults adequately represented the population but that our sample of 12 post-fledgling birds was insufficient, thereby limiting the confidence in our results for this life stage. The Commonwealth Government has the majority of management responsibility for shy albatross at-sea, containing 88% and 90% of the area occupied most intensively by adult and post-fledgling shy albatross, respectively. Randomly designed reserve networks outperformed the current MPA network for both life stages, such that the mean protection by a random reserve system was 30% and 12% higher than the actual protection for adults and juveniles in Commonwealth waters. Main conclusions: Important foraging habitat of shy albatross from Albatross Island is mostly within Commonwealth-managed waters. The current MPA network, the only spatial protection measure for shy albatross, provides less coverage for this species than a randomly placed network. An increase in the representation of productive shelf waters in MPA networks would benefit the conservation of shy albatross through reducing fisheries interactions and protecting habitat in these regions. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Among the numerous demographic parameters that influence population size, unbiased estimates of pre-fledging survival remain difficult to obtain for precocial birds. In this study, we used capture-mark-recapture modeling to estimate pre-fledging survival in a population of temperate-nesting Canada geese Branta canadensis maxima that has undergone an exponential increase over the last two decades. We examined whether pre-fledging survival was affected by relative hatch date, initial brood size, mother age, and weather conditions at hatching. Between 2005 and 2014, 8679 goslings were marked with web-tags at hatching at two adjacent sites. A total of 3922 of these birds were initially recaptured and banded before fledging while 338 were recaptured and banded in subsequent years as after-hatching year birds. Multistate models with joint live and dead encounters were used to estimate pre-fledging survival and evaluate the effects of rearing sites, gosling characteristics, and weather conditions at hatching. Pre-fledging survival of Canada geese varied between 0.45 (95% CI: 0.41-0.50) and 0.75 (0.62-0.84) among years and sites with an overall mean of 0.62 (0.54-0.68). Survival rates were lower for late hatched birds and tended to increase with initial brood size and mother age. Weather conditions at hatching did not affect pre-fledging survival. Significant effect of hatch date on pre-fledging survival has often been described in geese nesting in highly seasonal environments (e.g. the arctic) but our findings of such a relationship in temperate-nesting Canada geese indicate that a selection pressure on the timing of breeding can also occur at more stable temperate latitudes. © 2018 The Authors.},

abstract={Endemic species with distributions restricted to narrow elevational ranges in the Andes are among the least-known tropical birds and are also among the most vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures of climate change and habitat fragmentation. One such species is the Peruvian Piedtail (Phlogophilus harterti), a hummingbird endemic to the Andean foothills of central and southern Peru. To obtain basic ecological information and estimate population densities, we studied Peruvian Piedtails over an 12-year period (2006–2017) along an elevational gradient in Manu National Park in Peru. We calculated a density of 57.9 (95% CI: 36.2–81.4) individuals per km2, which is similar to estimates reported for other range-restricted Andean hummingbirds. Peruvian Piedtails were found at elevations between 867–1545 m, but were more common in areas with undisturbed forest, dense vegetation, and bamboo patches in a narrow elevational band of 400 m (900–1300 m). All nests were in dense clumps of hanging moss, and clutches always consisted of two eggs. The duration of incubation (19 d) and nestling (23 d) periods was within the range reported for other hummingbirds of similar size, but the growth rate of nestlings (K = 0.28) was relatively slow. Our observations suggest that Peruvian Piedtails are locally common, but only in specific habitats within their limited elevational range in southeastern Peru, and they may rely on patches of bamboo (Guadua sp.) for breeding. Thus, the broader extent of the occurrence and density of Peruvian Piedtails across their range should be evaluated to better inform their conservation status. © 2018 Association of Field Ornithologists},

abstract={Reliable demographic estimates hinge on the assumption that marking animals does not alter their behavior, reproduction, or survival. Violations can bias inference and are especially egregious for species of high conservation concern. Global positioning system (GPS) devices represent a recent technological advancement that has contributed greatly to avian ecological studies compared with traditionally used very high frequency (VHF) radio transmitters, but may affect demographic rates differently than VHF transmitters. We compared survival between VHF (necklace attachment) and GPS (rump-mounted attachment) devices from >1,100 Greater Sage-Grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus), a species of high conservation concern, across multiple populations within California and Nevada. We found lower survival for GPS-marked compared to VHF-marked sage-grouse across most sex, age, and seasonal comparisons. Estimates of annual survival for GPS-marked sage-grouse were 0.55-0.86 times that of VHF-marked birds with considerable variation among sex and age classes. Differences in survival could be attributed to features associated with GPS devices, including greater weight, position of attachment (e.g., rump-mount harness), and a semi-reflective solar panel. In a post hoc analysis, we evaluated additive and interactive effects between device type (GPS vs. VHF) and transmitter mass as a proportion of body mass (PBM). While the device type effect alone was the best model, the PBM interaction also had support. For GPS devices, survival decreased with increasing PBM, whereas PBM effects were not found for VHF. We attributed differences in PBM effect to placement of transmitters on sage-grouse, as weight of GPS devices was positioned rearward. This information can help managers and researchers weigh costs and benefits of GPS-based monitoring. Our results indicate demographic data collected from GPS devices should be interpreted with caution, and use of these devices should be tailored to specific ecological questions. Future research aimed at investigating behavioral impacts and GPS designs that reduce adverse impacts on survival would be beneficial. © 2019 Published by Oxford University Press for the American Ornithological Society.},

abstract={As carrion feeders competing for a limited and ephemeral resource, avian scavengers are ideal model organisms to study mechanisms of niche partitioning. Previous work has focused on observations of species’ interactions at carcasses, and although fruitful, the inclusion of behavior beyond that at carcasses, such as movement patterns, could yield a more comprehensive understanding of mechanisms of foraging niche partitioning. Our goal was to assess how differences in physiological, morphological, and social characteristics between sympatric black vultures (Coragyps atratus) and turkey vultures (Cathartes aura) manifest interspecific variation in movement patterns, foraging habitats, and carcass use to reduce direct competition. Both species are obligate scavengers that co-occur across much of the New World. Turkey vultures are solitary foragers with enhanced olfactory capabilities and wings optimized for energy-efficient low-altitude soaring. Black vultures are aggressive, heavier bodied, and forage socially. We assessed interspecific variation in carcass exploitation using experimental carcass trials encompassing a range of habitats, carcass sizes, and seasons, and used GPS telemetry to compare how soaring conditions influenced daily space use and diurnal patterns of movement activity for each species. Turkey vultures occurred more often at small (i.e., rabbit) carcasses, and those obscured by forest cover than black vultures, and were the first vultures recorded at 94% of carcasses visited by both species. Both species increased movement rates and daily ranges when soaring conditions were favorable; however, turkey vultures had higher travel rates regardless of soaring conditions. Our results suggest the olfactory sense of turkey vultures allows them to locate smaller and visually obscured carcasses more efficiently than black vultures, facilitated by wing morphology that allows them to forage over large areas efficiently. Socially foraging black vultures appear specialized at locating larger carcasses in open habitats, which does not require as much foraging flight as turkey vultures. Our study illustrates how inclusion of movement ecology into niche partitioning studies provides a more complete understanding of the mechanisms of coexistence in avian scavenger guilds. This approach may provide important information to guide conservation efforts, such as supplemental feeding, of imperiled vulture species. © 2019 The Authors.},

abstract={Mortality rates for precocial avian species are highest during their first year of life. For harvested species, including waterfowl, it is particularly difficult to determine causes of mortality using standard mark–recapture techniques. The timing and cause of nonhunting mortality is difficult for researchers to distinguish, and therefore, difficult to incorporate into management decisions. We marked flightless Canada goose Branta canadensis interior goslings with radio transmitters to determine the timing of mortality prior to harvest during the fall migration. We tracked survival of 206 goslings for 2 mo from an average of 50 d of age to just prior to the fall migration departure from the breeding grounds in 1999 and 2000. The most parsimonious model from a set of candidate models describing probability of survival showed clear differences between years and suggested that survival was affected by gosling size (largest survived better) and hatch timing disparity. We indexed hatch timing disparity by measuring the difference between gosling hatch date and the date of the estimated peak in forage quality as determined by the normalized difference vegetation index. The latest hatched goslings presumably had the lowest quality forage available to them. Both size and hatch timing disparity concur with a mortality cause that is most likely from complications due to malnutrition. The estimated survival probability of goslings to 51 d post marking was 0.31 (95% confidence limit ¼ 0.22 to 0.44) in 1999 and 0.69 (95% confidence limit ¼ 0.57 to 0.83) in 2000. Managers can make better informed decisions concerning the utility of harvest regulation in the conservation of juvenile Canada geese by better understanding the timing, causes, and annual variation of their mortality. © 2019 U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

abstract={Spotted seals Phoca largha and bearded seals Erignathus barbatus are ice-associated seals that have overlapping range in the Beaufort, Chukchi, and Bering Seas, but have different foraging ecologies. The link between foraging behaviour and specific oceanographic variables is not well understood for these species, nor is the influence of different dive metrics when modelling their foraging behaviour. To explore the value of different dive metrics to estimate foraging behaviour, and the relationships between foraging and water bodies/oceanographic variables, we tagged 3 spotted seals and 2 bearded seals with satellite telemetry tags that recorded movement and oceanographic data. To infer foraging behaviour, we included dive metrics in Bayesian state-space switching models, and found that models that included depth-corrected dive duration were more parsimonious than models that included dive shape. The addition of vertical movements to the model enabled better determination of foraging areas (inferred from area-restricted searches) and provided insights into the probabilities of switching between foraging and transiting behaviours. The collection of oceanographic data in situ at a scale relevant to seals helped identify water masses, and how they were used, and potential oceanographic cues used by seals to identify foraging locations. Fine-scale spatiotemporal clustering analysis revealed spotted and bearded seal foraging ‘hotspots’ in the Chukchi and Bering Seas that overlap with hotspots identified for other marine mammals and marine birds. © Inter-Research 2019},

abstract={The adaptation of birds to urban environments has created direct hazards to air transportation with the potential for catastrophic incidents. Bird-aircraft collisions involving Canada geese (Branta canadensis; goose) pose greater risks to aircraft than many bird species due to their size and flocking behavior. However, information on factors driving movements of geese near airports and within aircraft arrival/departure areas for application to management are limited. To address this need, we deployed 31 neck collar-mounted global positioning system transmitters on Canada geese near Midway International Airport in Chicago, Illinois, USA during November 2015 to February 2016. We used the movement data obtained to model environmental and behavioral factors influencing the intersection of goose movements (i.e., transition from 1 location to another) with air operations areas (i.e., aircraft flight paths). Of 3,008 goose movements recorded, 821 intersected a 3-km buffer around the airport representing U.S. Federal Aviation Administration recommended distances from wildlife attractants, and 399 intersected flight paths for approaching and landing aircraft. The effects of weather (i.e., snow cover, temperature, wind speed) on the probability of geese flying varied with different air operation areas while certain habitat resources greatly increased the probability of intersection. For example, the juxtaposition of foraging (railyards with spilled grain) and loafing areas (rooftops) near the airport led to a higher probability of movements intersecting important air operations areas. The average altitude of flying geese was 29.8 m above the ground, resulting in the greatest risk of collision being within 0.5 km of the end of runways. We suggest airport goose collision mitigation management actions, such as reducing habitat resources near the airport and using focused nonlethal harassment or physical modifications, when guided by animal movement data, may further mitigate birdstrike risks. © 2019, Jack H.

abstract={Staging, an essential part of shorebird migration, is when birds concentrate in large numbers to rest and refuel. Abundance estimates at key staging sites offer promise to monitor many transient migrant populations; however, stopover chronology is needed. Point counts were conducted of all shorebirds staging at Chaplin and Reed Lakes, Saskatchewan, Canada (May-June 2014-2017). Stopover durations of individual Sanderlings (Calidris alba) were obtained using automated radio telemetry of individual Sanderlings tagged both locally and in the Gulf of Mexico (April-May 2015-2017). Seventeen Arctic-breeding shorebird species were recorded during point counts. Sanderlings were the most abundant and reached peak numbers during the last week of May. Estimates of Sanderling stopover duration varied by year and estimation method: "true stopover duration" (radio-tagged in Gulf of Mexico with known arrival and departure) was 11.1 days (95% CI = 8.6-13.6); "minimum stopover duration" (radio-tagged at Chaplin Lake with unknown arrival but known departure) was 11.9 days (95% CI = 11.1-12.7); and "estimated stopover duration" (Pradel Survival and Seniority models) was 19.9 days (95% CI = 17.5-22.7). Assuming an average 11-day stopover, we estimated ~75,000 Sanderlings (Range = 56,000-91,000) or 12% of the global population use this site during spring migration. These findings highlight the importance of accurate migration chronology to monitor Arctic-breeding shorebird populations. © 2019 The Waterbird Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We simulated bird surveys using recorded bird songs to assess factors affecting detection probability in grassland bird point counts. We used mixed effects logistic regression models to estimate effects of those factors and to estimate and visualize the variation in the area around the observer where birds can be perceived (the perception area). We simulated surveys with 8,926 binary opportunities for detection in Minnesota grasslands in 2011 and 2012. Species, distance to the observer, wind speed and direction, observer, and density of vegetation all affected detection of recorded bird songs. Species had a strong effect; the size of the predicted perception area around the observer differed by an order of magnitude among species. Wind also had a strong effect on detection. As wind speed increased, probability of detection downwind of the observer was reduced and the perception area around the observer became smaller and more asymmetrical. The effective distance at which an observer is more likely to detect a bird than not detect it may differ among species and angles to the wind, even within the same survey. Eight of 10 species had low probability of misidentification (≤0.03), but Grasshopper Sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum) and LeConte's Sparrow (Ammospiza leconteii) were frequently misidentified (probability = 0.09-0.24 among observers), contributing to a low rate of correct detection for those species. We recommend collecting point-count data within distance bands so that data can be analyzed based on the effective radius for each species and standardizing surveys across wind conditions to reduce variation in detection probability. © 2019 American Ornithological Society.

abstract={Greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) have been subject to long-term and continuing declines in population and habitat since European settlement of western North America. Increased wildfire activity constitutes a primary threat to the species in western portions of their range, with documented declines in wildfire-affected populations. Following a 187,000-ha wildfire in southeastern Oregon and northern Nevada, USA, we used global positioning system (GPS) telemetry to monitor nest initiation, nest survival, nesting habitat, and adult survival of female sage-grouse during 2013 and 2014. We used known-fate models in Program MARK to estimate daily nest survival and monthly adult survival in relation to temporal patterns, physiological characteristics of females, and habitat and land-cover characteristics. We assessed habitat characteristics using geographic information system (GIS)-derived measures of post-fire habitat condition and land cover. Nest initiation rate following the fire was comparable to that observed in unaltered habitat. We observed nesting rates of 90% and 100% during 2013 and 2014, respectively, and renesting rates of 23% and 57% during the same years. Daily nest survival was consistently low in comparison to rates observed in concurrent studies in the region, for first nests during both years, and for second nests during 2013, but survival markedly increased for second nests during 2014. Sage-grouse generally did not leave the fire perimeter to nest, with 64% and 73% of nests located in the fire boundary during 2013 and 2014, respectively. Approximately 27% of nests were located in burned habitat during 2013, and 20% of nests in 2014 were located in burned habitat. Adult survival varied by month, and although patterns of monthly survival were similar between years, monthly survival rates were significantly reduced from the beginning of the study through the end of the first post-fire growing season. Our results indicate that sage-grouse continue to use fire-affected habitat in the years immediately following wildfire and sage-grouse experienced lower nest survival and adult female survival than other populations during the same period. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={Long distance migration can increase lifetime fitness, but can be costly, incurring increased energetic expenses and higher mortality risks. Stopover and other en route behaviors allow animals to rest and replenish energy stores and avoid or mitigate other hazards during migration. Some animals, such as soaring birds, can subsidize the energetic costs of migration by extracting energy from flowing air. However, it is unclear how these energy sources affect or interact with behavioral processes and stopover in long-distance soaring migrants. To understand these behaviors and the effects of processes that might enhance use of flight subsidies, we developed a flexible mechanistic model to predict how flight subsidies drive migrant behavior and movement processes. The novel modeling framework incorporated time-varying parameters informed by environmental covariates to characterize a continuous range of behaviors during migration. This model framework was fit to GPS satellite telemetry data collected from a large soaring and opportunist foraging bird, the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), during migration in western North America. Fitted dynamic model parameters revealed a clear circadian rhythm in eagle movement and behavior, which was directly related to thermal uplift. Behavioral budgets were complex, however, with evidence for a joint migrating/foraging behavior, resembling a slower paced fly-and-forage migration, which could facilitate efficient refueling while still ensuring migration progress. In previous work, ecological and foraging conditions are usually considered to be the key aspects of stopover location quality, but taxa, such as the golden eagle, that can tap energy sources from moving fluids to drive migratory locomotion may pace migration based on both foraging opportunities and available flight subsidies. © 2019 Eisaguirre, Auger-Méthé, Barger, Lewis, Booms and Breed.},

abstract={Human hunting activity and disturbance can significantly impact prey species through both consumptive and nonconsumptive effects. The nonconsumptive effects of rabbit hunting on Northern Bobwhite (Colinus virginianus; hereafter, bobwhite) are currently unknown. Increased perceived risk of predation by bobwhite during rabbit hunting events may elicit antipredator responses among bobwhite that impact fitness via changes in behavior that ultimately impact population growth. We estimated the nonconsumptive effects of rabbit hunting on bobwhite behavior using telemetry across varying rabbit hunting intensities. Movements were analyzed using Bayesian hierarchical modeling with a before-after-control-impact (BACI) design to determine the effect of rabbit hunting on bobwhite. We observed an overall reduction in bobwhite movement in the presence of rabbit hunting, with a 38% (Posterior Overlap = 0.01) increase in bobwhite step length in the absence of rabbit hunting. We also observed bobwhite maintaining closer proximity to hardwood and escape cover under high rabbit hunting intensity, with a 59% (Posterior Overlap = 0.03) increase in distance from hardwood and a 28% (Posterior Overlap = 0.14) increase in distance from escape cover when rabbit hunting was removed. Synthesis and applications. Heightened antipredator behavior through decreased movement may assist with bobwhite predator avoidance. However, decreased movement and increased use of poor habitats may also have negative effects as a result of reduced foraging time or increased susceptibility to other predators. Future research should attempt to quantify the effect of decreased movement on bobwhite fitness through the evaluation of foraging time and survival in order to continue to improve management efforts for the species. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={On average, band recovery rates of adult black brant (Branta bernicla nigricans) more than doubled between the 2000s and 2010s. However, the spatial distribution of band recoveries of black brant has not been reported. Our objective was to describe the spatial distribution of band recoveries of black brant since 1990. We found that Alaska, California, and Mexico accounted for ≥89% of band recoveries for black brant released from the Arctic and the Tutakoke River Colony in southwestern Alaska, in each decade studied. Although recovery rates increased in each major harvest region from the 1990s to 2010s, increases were not even. For brant released from the Arctic, the recovery rate in Alaska has gone up 7-fold, whereas the recovery rate in Mexico has increased 1.3-fold since the 1990s. For brant banded in the Arctic, the increased recovery rates in Alaska resulted largely from a rise in recoveries from the Izembek Lagoon area. For brant banded at the Tutakoke River Colony, the recovery rate in Alaska increased 4.8-fold, whereas recovery rates in Mexico increased 1.6-fold. Despite the reduced relative contribution of Mexico to band recoveries in the 2010s, Bahia San Quintin, Mexico, still contributes more recoveries than any other wintering estuary. Because 57–60% of black brant band recoveries occur at the localities of Izembek Lagoon, Alaska; Humboldt Bay, California; and Bahia San Quintin, it is likely that accurate annual estimates of the black brant population using Lincoln's method could be derived from hunter bag checks at these 3 areas. If population managers are interested in managing harvest rates of black brant, they could focus efforts on the main hunting areas we highlight in this paper. Finally, it is unclear if the recent increases in band recovery rates are the result of increased harvest, a declining population, or both; therefore, we suggest refinement of population monitoring programs and continued monitoring of band recovery rates. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

abstract={Parental care is widely assumed to be costly, and life-history theory predicts that individuals that invest more in parental care should benefit in terms of number of offspring produced but that increased parental care might come at a cost in terms of decreased future fecundity and/or survival. However, the notion that parents that work ‘harder’ commonly measured by the rate at which parents visit the nestbox to provision their chicks, produce more, fitter chicks is surprisingly poorly supported. One potential reason for this apparent lack of relationship between measured workload during parental care and breeding productivity is that nest visit rate does not provide a good measure of foraging effort. Here, we used an automated radiotelemetry system to measure activity of individual female European starlings, Sturnus vulgaris, during breeding, combined with a handicapping experiment (combination of radiotransmitters and wing clipping) and measures of foraging metrics, current breeding productivity, future fecundity and return rate. Handicapping decreased current breeding success due to higher abandonment and nest failure, but among successful birds (fledging ≥ 1 chick) there was no effect of handicapping on brood size at fledging for the current breeding attempt. Handicapping decreased future fecundity, the probability of initiating a second brood, and return rate, but there was no evidence for additive costs of reproduction in wing-clipped females. Handicapping had no effect on provisioning rate but automated tracking data showed that, during chick rearing, wing-clipped females had 22% lower activity compared to females with radios only. Our data provide an explanation for the often contradictory effects of handicapping reported on reproductive effort and costs of reproduction: individuals can use behavioural flexibility – decreasing overall activity while maintaining provisioning rate – along with changes in mass and nestling diet to mitigate putative effects of increased workload imposed by handicapping. © 2018 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour},

abstract={Mottled ducks (Anas fulvigula) were released by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) in South Carolina, USA, during 1975–1983 and expanded into Georgia, USA, in the 1990s. Banding data suggest that birds marked in Georgia are often harvested in other states. Because the South Carolina reintroduced population was able to expand into Georgia via long-distance dispersal, a more thorough understanding of mottled duck spatial ecology in Georgia and South Carolina is needed to direct future management decisions to accommodate expanding duck populations. We used global positioning system (GPS) telemetry to investigate movements and habitat selection by 47 mottled ducks (17 males, 30 females) during 4 seasons from 2013–2016. Mean seasonal home ranges varied from 2,002–4,598 ha across sexes and seasons. We found mean distances moved within seasonal ranges varied from 3.5–11.3 km/day for birds captured in Georgia, and 1.3–5.6 km/day for those captured in South Carolina. We observed 23 excursions, in which individuals left established seasonal ranges for >6 hours and moved ≥5 km; these excursions ranged from 5 km to 139.5 km. We documented 5 dispersals ranging from 52.6 km to 245.8 km. We also documented several long-distance movements, with 7 birds captured in Georgia moving to South Carolina and 2 moving to Florida, USA. These movements suggest mottled ducks in South Carolina and Georgia may constitute a single population. Notably, we observed dispersal and long-distance movements only from birds marked in Georgia, suggesting that habitat may be a limiting factor along the Georgia coast. We quantified third-order selection for mottled ducks and found seasonal selection for managed impoundments and avoidance of palustrine emergent marsh during breeding and teal seasons. Managed impoundments were limited to 4 river systems along coastal Georgia and South Carolina, resulting in much of the coastal wetlands in both states being unused by mottled ducks. We suggest the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (GADNR) and SCDNR work cooperatively to manage mottled ducks and their habitats by focusing efforts to create and manage impoundments throughout the Santee, Savannah, Altamaha, and Ashepoo-Combahe-Edisto (ACE) river basins in coastal Georgia and South Carolina where we documented use. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018},

We monitored nesting Golden Eagles in a 2700 km 2 area of south-central Montana from 2010-2017. As part of our effort, we fitted 16 adult and 13 nestlings with platform terminal transmitters for satellite telemetry. We determined causes of mortality from recovered Golden Eagles and, using multi-state models in program MARK, we estimated monthly and annual survival probabilities. We confirmed five total mortalities, including two cases of lead toxicity, one occurrence of intraspecific aggression, and two mortalities with unknown cause. The monthly survival estimate of adult Golden Eagles in our study area was 0.994 and the annual adult survival probability was 0.930. The monthly survival probability estimate from birds transmittered as nestlings was 0.991 and the annual survival estimate was 0.897. Lead toxicity and intraspecific aggression are known causes of Golden Eagle mortality, but the birds we tracked died from lead toxicity at a higher rate than would be expected based on results from other studies. The survival probability estimates from the Golden Eagles we monitored were higher than reported estimates from other locations. Further, the information we provide can assist with the development of population matrices and increase our knowledge on causes of Golden Eagle mortality. © 2019 The Raptor Research Foundation, Inc.},

abstract={Counts of males displaying on breeding grounds are the primary management tool used to assess population trends in lekking grouse species. Despite the importance of male lek attendance (i.e., proportion of males on leks available for detection) influencing lek counts, patterns of within season and between season variability in attendance rates are not well understood. We used high-frequency global positioning system (GPS) telemetry data from male greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; n = 67) over five lekking seasons (2013–2017) at eight study sites in Nevada to estimate lek attendance rates. Specifically, we recorded daily locations of sage-grouse in relation to mapped lek boundaries and used generalized additive models to assess temporal variation in attendance rates by age class (subadult vs. adult). Average timing of peak attendance occurred on 16 April but varied from March 16, 2014 to April 21, 2016. Overall, adult males attended leks at higher rates (0.683 at peak) and earlier in the season (19 March) than subadults (0.421 at peak on April 19). Peak attendance probability was positively related to cumulative winter precipitation. Daily probabilities of lek switching differed between adults (0.019 at peak on March 3) and subadults (0.046 at peak on March 22), and lek switching was negatively related to distance to nearest lek. Our results indicate variable patterns in lek attendance through time, and that lek switching may occur at higher rates than previously thought. We demonstrate the use of generalizable daily attendance curves to date-correct lek counts and derive estimates of male abundance, although such an approach will likely require the incorporation of information on age structure to produce robust results that are useful for population monitoring. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Variation in fire characteristics, termed pyrodiversity, plays an important role in structuring post-fire communities, but little is known about the importance of pyrodiversity for individual species. The availability of diverse post-fire habitats may be key for fire-associated species if they require different resources at different life-history stages. We tested for age-specific habitat relationships in the black-backed woodpecker, a post-fire specialist. We used radio-telemetry to track fledgling and adult woodpeckers in burned forests and built resource selection functions to compare the effect of stand-, tree- and snag-level covariates between adults and fledglings. Fledgling black-backed woodpeckers selected habitat with more live trees than adults and used more heterogeneous habitats burned at lower severity, illustrating strong age-dependent effects on habitat selection. Within selected stands, fledglings were less likely to use snags and more likely to use live trees when compared to adults, but both age classes showed strong positive selection for larger-diameter trees (live and dead). Over the 60 days after leaving their nests, fledglings showed an increasing propensity to use snags rather than live trees. Our results provide evidence that the predation–starvation hypothesis, which posits a trade-off between foraging efficiency and the need to minimise predation risk, plays a role in structuring the age-dependent habitat use of a burned forest specialist. Adult black-backed woodpeckers selected resources associated with food availability, but these resources occurred in relatively open, exposed habitat. Fledglings selected habitat that provided increased cover, perhaps as a strategy to reduce predation risk. Synthesis and applications. Globally, fires are increasing in severity and extent, leading to increased focus on fire-associated species that play keystone roles in facilitating biodiversity resilience. Our findings suggest that a diversity of patches burned at different severities may benefit post-fire specialists like the black-backed woodpecker at multiple life-history stages. The increasing prevalence of large, homogeneously high-severity ‘megafires’ may present an emerging threat even to post-fire specialists, and we urge land managers to consider opportunities to promote pyrodiversity in the face of novel fire regimes. © 2018 The Authors.

abstract={Determining how an animal's social context alters its immune responses will help us understand how pathogens impact individual health and spread within groups. Several studies have shown that group-housed animals can suppress components of the acute phase immune response, specifically sickness behaviors like lethargy. However, we do not know whether individuals alter sickness behaviors or other components of the acute phase response, including thermoregulation, in response to the infection status of other group members. We used automated radio telemetry on captive house sparrows (Passer domesticus) to test whether sickness behaviors and thermoregulation differed during immune challenge under 2 social contexts: 1) all of the flock inoculated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a non-replicating component of gram-negative bacterial cell walls, or 2) half of the flock inoculated. We predicted that with half of the flock inoculated, LPS-treated birds would be under more pressure to maintain competitive behaviors, so would suppress components of the acute phase response. As we predicted, LPS-inoculated birds showed less pronounced heterothermia (fever) when housed with a mixture of inoculated and healthy flockmates. In contrast, LPS-inoculated birds exhibited similar degrees of lethargy regardless of the infection status of their flockmates. Our results show that the infection status of an individual's social group did exert an effect on the acute phase response but surprisingly did not impact the expression of lethargy, a canonical sickness behavior. Determining the mechanisms underlying these responses will require testing additional social contexts with different ratios of infected to uninfected birds. © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={The degree to which foraging individuals are able to appropriately modify their behaviors in response to dynamic environmental conditions and associated resource availability can have important fitness consequences. Despite an increasingly refined understanding of differences in foraging behavior between individuals, we still lack detailed characterizations of within-individual variation over space and time, and what factors may drive this variability. From 2014 to 2017, we used GPS transmitters and accelerometers to document foraging movements by breeding adult Brown Pelicans (Pelecanus occidentalis) in the northern Gulf of Mexico, where the prey landscape is patchy and dynamic at various scales. Assessments of traditional foraging metrics such as trip distance, linearity, or duration did not yield significant relationships between individuals. However, we did observe lower site fidelity and less variation in energy expenditure in birds of higher body condition, despite a population-level trend of increased fidelity as the breeding season progressed. These findings suggest that high-quality individuals are both more variable and more efficient in their foraging behaviors during a period of high energetic demand, consistent with a "rich get richer" scenario in which individuals in better condition are able to invest in more costly behaviors that provide higher returns. This work highlights the importance of considering behavioral variation at multiple scales, with particular reference to within-individual variation, to improve our understanding of foraging ecology in wild populations. © 2018 The Author(s).

abstract={The Shining Sunbeam (Aglaeactis cupripennis) is a widespread and relatively common high-elevation hummingbird in the tropical Andes. Despite this, there is no comprehensive record of its natural history. In this study we present our findings on the diet and territorial behavior of Shining Sunbeam at sites in Peru and Ecuador. Using radio telemetry to track and observe individuals, we examined territory size and vegetation characteristics, activity budgets, diet composition, and territorial aggression. We found that average territory size was 0.13 ha (SD 0.05) with 100% minimum convex polygon estimation and 0.19 ha (SD 0.06) with 95% kernel density estimation. We found high variation in territory sizes, which was not explained by locality, year of data collection, or flower density. The diet of the Shining Sunbeam within our study sites was composed primarily of nectar from flowers of the tree Oreocallis grandiflora (Proteaceae), which comprised 93% (SD 9) of all nectar feeding events in Peru and 99% (SD 1) in Ecuador. Other flowering plant resources included Brachyotum, Centropogon, Fuchsia, Gaultheria, and Macleania. Insects made up 7% (SD 4) and 3% (SD 1) of observed foraging events of A. cupripennis in Ecuador and Peru, respectively. Mean activity budgets across individual birds were 68% (SD 16) perching, 28% (SD 15) foraging, 3% (SD 3) in aggressive behavior, and 2% (SD 1) in nonaggressive flight. Of the observed aggressive interactions, the majority were directed toward other hummingbirds (77% in Ecuador and 84% in Peru). When only considering interactions with hummingbirds, most aggression was intraspecific in Ecuador (71%) but interspecific in Peru (95%). We observed aggressive behavior directed toward other common, non-hummingbird nectarivores, such as Diglossa flowerpiercers, while aggression directed toward non-nectarivores was rare. Our results highlight the need for comparative studies to better understand hummingbird foraging and territorial behavior in the Andes, and the utility of radio telemetry for studying larger hummingbird species like the Shining Sunbeam. . © 2019 Wilson Ornithological Society.

abstract={The June Sucker Chasmistes liorus mictus is a large-bodied catostomid endemic to Utah Lake, Utah. It is a federally listed endangered species, and one component to its recovery is a stocking program with a target of releasing 2.8 million fish averaging 200 mm long. Because size is implicated as a factor in poststocking survival of western native fishes, particularly in the presence of nonnative fishes, over a 4-year period a combination of telemetry and remote sensing was used to demonstrate size-specific poststocking survival of June Sucker in Utah Lake. A total of 88 June Sucker were released with acoustic tags to estimate short-Term survival, and remote PIT scanners were deployed to examine longterm survival. Survival of telemetry fish varied from 0.0 to 0.83, with larger fish exhibiting the greatest survival in the final year. Size-specific survival was most evident in the analysis of PIT scanning data in which survival ranged from 2% for fish shorter than 200 mm to 90% for fish stocked at 300 mm. The causes of mortality are unknown, but likely culprits are nonnative fish and piscivorous birds. Both are well documented preying on June Sucker and similar species. Controlling predation may be impractical, but releasing fewer numbers of larger fish presumably will increase or maintain the population and be more cost effective than the current strategy. Overall, conservation and recovery of June Sucker will be a challenging endeavor going forward. © 2019.},

abstract={Aim: Vertebrates are declining worldwide, yet a comprehensive examination of the sources of mortality is lacking. We conducted a global synthesis of terrestrial vertebrate cause-specific mortality to compare the sources of mortality across taxa and determine predictors of susceptibility to these sources of mortality. Location: Worldwide. Time period: 1970–2018. Major taxa studied: Mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians. Methods: We searched for studies that used telemetry to determine the cause of death of terrestrial vertebrates. We determined whether each mortality was caused by anthropogenic or natural sources and further classified mortalities within these two categories (e.g. harvest, vehicle collision and predation). For each study, we determined the diet and average adult body mass of the species and whether the study site permitted hunting. Mortalities were separated into juvenile or adult age classes. We used linear mixed effects models to predict the percentage of mortality from each source and the overall magnitude of mortality based on these variables. Results: We documented 42,755 mortalities of known cause from 120,657 individuals representing 305 vertebrate species in 1,114 studies. Overall, 28% of mortalities were directly caused by humans and 72% from natural sources. Predation (55%) and legal harvest (17%) were the leading sources of mortality. Main conclusions: Humans were directly responsible for more than one-quarter of global terrestrial vertebrate mortality. Larger birds and mammals were harvested more often and suffered increased anthropogenic mortality. Anthropogenic mortality of mammals and birds outside areas that prohibited hunting was higher than within areas where hunting was prohibited. Mammals experienced shifts from predominately natural to anthropogenic mortality as they matured. Humans are a major contributor to terrestrial vertebrate mortality, potentially impacting evolutionary processes and ecosystem functioning. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={The greater sage-grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus; sage-grouse) has undergone range contraction and population decline because of anthropogenic land surface disturbances; yet, there is little information on the effects of mining on sage-grouse populations. In the Bighorn Basin of Montana and Wyoming, USA, bentonite mining is a growing source of surface disturbance that contributes to loss of sagebrush (Artemisia spp.) habitat. We evaluated the response of sage-grouse to active and reclaimed bentonite mining, relative to nesting, brood-rearing, adult breeding, and adult winter habitat, through resource selection and habitat-specific mortality risk analyses, based on female sage-grouse (n = 321) monitored with telemetry from 2011–2015. A greater proportion of our monitored sample was exposed to mining disturbance during winter (65%) than during other seasons (range = 25%–34%). We observed avoidance of all mining disturbance for selection of nesting habitat (n = 378 nests), adult breeding habitat (n = 1,978 locations), and adult winter habitat (n = 1,365 locations). Evidence was inconclusive for avoidance of mining for brood-rearing habitat (n = 754 locations). We also observed increased adult breeding season mortality risk (n = 62 mortality events; n = 285 female sage-grouse) associated with active mining disturbance but observed no effect on nest success (n = 207 mortality events; n = 378 nests). Evidence was inconclusive for increased mortality risk associated with broods (n = 48 mortality events; n = 157 broods) and adults during winter (n = 31 mortality events; n = 220 female sage-grouse). Stakeholders in the Bighorn Basin should be flexible and proactive to minimize the negative effects of bentonite mining on sage-grouse habitat use and demographic rates. Stakeholders should prioritize the conservation of winter habitats because of the influence on a greater proportion of the population and because of the lower regulatory priority given to winter habitat and they should strive to perfect mining reclamation to return disturbed sites back to pre-disturbance conditions to minimize long-term effects of the mines on sage-grouse. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2019},

Their attraction to airfields and their large body size makes them a danger to aircraft and therefore important to airfield managers. However, bald eagle management is complicated by their special protected status and the place they hold in the eyes of the public. To help airfield managers plan monitoring efforts and make informed management decisions, we studied the movements of 32 bald eagles telemetered as nestlings in the Chesapeake Bay, Virginia, USA, 2013–2018. Managers often need to know when fledged eagles are most likely to move enough to encounter airfields near nests. As fledglings aged, they moved progressively farther from the nest and spent more time away from the nest. Twenty-eight days after fledging, eagles spent most of the day (81 ± 10% [95% CI]) near the nest (<500 m) and only 7 ± 7% of the daytime away from the nest (>1 km). By day 55 fledglings ventured beyond 2.5 km from the nest and spent 32 ± 15% the day >1 km away from their nest. Distances moved, however, were influenced by proximity of the nest to water, the salinity of that water, and human population density. Eagles left their natal nests and generally migrated out of the Chesapeake Bay 60.5 ± 7.7 days (4 Aug) after fledging and returned to the Chesapeake Bay approximately 220 days later (Mar–Apr). Eighty-four percent (27 of 32) of the eagles that we tracked encountered 164 airfields across the east coast with 91% of those airfields located within 10 km of the Chesapeake Bay. Encounters with airfields outside the Chesapeake Bay occurred mainly during the first 1.5 years of life, peaking in late fall and early spring. We recorded eagles on Chesapeake Bay airfields during each year, but encounters peaked in April of the first year of the bird's life. April coincides with the height of reported strikes of eagles by aircraft in the region. Our results suggest that eagles fledging from the Chesapeake Bay are an issue for airports near the Chesapeake Bay and for airports across the east coast. Given the continued growth of the population, this issue is likely to continue and grow in significance. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2019},

abstract={The multiscale nature of habitat selection during the breeding season for migratory birds means that core-use areas (e.g., breeding territories) are selected based on their local habitat features, but these may also be influenced in some way by features within a larger-scale landscape. We conducted a reciprocal transplant experiment to test the hypothesis that habitat selection and movements of male American Woodcock (Scolopax minor) in core-use areas during the breeding season depend on the perceived quality of the surrounding landscape. We captured second-year male woodcocks (n = 19) at high-or low-likelihood of use landscapes in Rhode Island, USA, affixed each with a radio transmitter, relocated them to the opposite type of landscape, and then determined if they returned to their original site of capture or remained in the landscape to which they were relocated. Birds captured in high-likelihood landscapes and moved to low-likelihood landscapes generally returned to their original high-likelihood landscape (5/7, 71%), but birds captured in low-likelihood landscapes and moved to high-likelihood landscapes rarely returned to their original lowlikelihood landscape (1/12, 8%). These results support the hypothesis that woodcock assess their surroundings relatively rapidly and subsequently make critical settlement decisions based on landscape composition. Given that woodcock choice is predicted by the woodcock-specific resource selection function, these results also provide support for the use of this tool to guide forest management for woodcock.

abstract={Southern New England provides key wintering habitat for White-winged Scoters (Melanitta fusca). This area has also pioneered the development of offshore wind energy in North America. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) has established 9 Wind Energy Area (WEA) lease blocks along the Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf in areas that may provide important staging and wintering habitat for scoters and other species of sea ducks. Concern over the potential impact of offshore wind energy on sea duck populations has led to efforts to develop models to understand their distribution, habitat use, and site fidelity. We used satellite telemetry to document winter phenology and site fidelity, as well as fine-scale resource selection and habitat use, of 40 White-winged Scoters along the southern New England continental shelf. Scoters spent over half of the annual cycle on the wintering grounds and demonstrated a high degree of interannual site fidelity to composite core-use areas. Sizes of individual 50% core-use home ranges were variable (X = 868 km2; range: 32-4,220 km2) and individual 95% utilization distributions ranged widely (X = 4,388 km2; range: 272-18,235 km2). More than half of all tagged birds occupied 2 or more discrete core-use areas that were up to 400 km apart. Throughout the study area, scoters selected areas with lower salinity, lower sea surface temperature, higher chlorophyll-a concentrations, and higher hard-bottom substrate probability. Resource selection function models classified 18,649 km2 (23%) of the study area as high probability of use, which included or immediately bordered ~420 km2 of proposed WEA lease blocks. Future offshore wind energy developments in the region should avoid key habitats highlighted by this study and carefully consider the environmental characteristics selected by sea ducks when planning and siting future WEAs.

abstract={A major uncertainty in automated radio-telemetry studies of small birds is the detection range of receiving antennas. We compared simultaneous daytime detections (± 30 s) by automated and manual radio-telemetry to assess detection probability and the proportion of transmissions detected for birds on migratory stopover as a function of distance, foraging guild (Black-throated Blue Warblers, Setophaga caerulescens, and Yellow-rumped Warblers, Dendroica coronata coronata, represented mid-canopy foliage gleaners and White-throated Sparrows, Zonotrichia albicollis, represented a ground forager), habitat type, meteorological variables, tower antenna number (1–4), and the position of a bird relative to the receiving antenna's bearing (offset angle). Our study was conducted at a migratory stopover site in southern Ontario, Canada. Most detections were in dense to sparse forest, and all individuals were within 1.03 km of the automated receiving station. Daily detection probability was near 100% for both foraging guilds. However, within 30 s before and after a manual radio-telemetry location was made, detection probability and the proportion of transmissions detected by automated radio-telemetry declined with distance, was higher for warblers than sparrows, and was lowest for 90° offset angles. Our results suggest that when research goals do not require detections with high temporal frequency, e.g., estimation of departure date or daily departure probability, our study design had an effective detection range of at least 1 km. However, where temporal precision is required, e.g., to investigate movements and changes in activity levels during stopover, detection range was ~300 m for ground-foraging sparrows and 600 m for mid-canopy foraging warblers, which is much lower than the presumed detection range of antennas under optimal conditions (15 km). This corresponds to a spatial area of coverage for forest-dwelling birds of ~0.3–1.1 km2. Our results suggest that to optimally configure an automated radio-telemetry array at the regional scale, investigators should carefully consider detection range and its underlying covariates, including species type, the habitat matrix, and the orientation of antennas relative to preferred habitat. © 2019 Association of Field Ornithologists},

abstract={Improved knowledge of movements of the Interior population of Band-tailed Pigeons (Patagioenas fasciata) is needed to inform management decisions. We investigated daily and seasonal movements of adult Bandtailed Pigeons marked with satellite transmitters in 2015-2016. Band-tailed Pigeons were marked at 3 geographically separate locations in Silver City, Weed, and Los Alamos, New Mexico, USA. Thirteen of 15 satellite transmitters provided sufficient data to estimate daily and seasonal movements. Mean daily movements ranged from 1.8 km to 17.8 km for individual Band-tailed Pigeons. Minimum distance moved between consecutive locations was less than detectable given accuracy of PTT transmitters, while the maximum distance moved between locations was 553.7 km. Seven of the 13 Band-tailed Pigeons made seasonal movements (>200 km) from their respective capture sites. Five Band-tailed Pigeons captured in southern New Mexico traveled south into northern Mexico whereas 2 Band-tailed Pigeons captured in northern New Mexico migrated to southern New Mexico for the nonbreeding season. Our results are the first to provide detailed movement information between breeding season and nonbreeding season sites for adult Band-tailed Pigeons captured in New Mexico. This data will allow a greater understanding of daily and seasonal movements of Band-tailed Pigeons from New Mexico and will aid in more targeted, collaborative conservation and management. © 2019 Wilson Ornithological Society.

abstract={Birds select critical resources to meet needs that vary in response to spatial, temporal, and individual variation. As an example, perch or roost sites may be at locations that provide protection from predators, mobbing, or inclement weather. Applied to large, soaring predators, this theory suggests that they may select perch and roost sites near food resources or at sites where environmental updrafts develop. To test these theories, we characterized selection of nonflight locations throughout the annual cycle for Golden Eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) in eastern North America. We determined factors associated with selection of perching (daytime) and roosting (nighttime) sites by eagles by comparing land cover and topographic characteristics of GPS telemetry locations for eagles (used) with random (available) locations. We separately assessed selection for perch and roost sites during each of 4 seasons (winter, summer, and spring and fall migration). Golden Eagles showed different selection patterns for perching by season and age. Throughout the year, eagles selected perch sites on steep slopes. The direction these slopes faced differed among seasons, with eagles selecting south-facing slopes in summer and east-facing slopes during migration. Adults showed greater preferences for broadleaf forests in summer and for ridges in fall. Patterns of perch-site use were consistent with selection for sites that provide thermal protection and access to thermal updrafts. We found few patterns of selection for roosting sites. Our analysis provides insight into decision-making by a longdistance migrant across its annual cycle and throughout its geographic range, and thus into how resource selection changes seasonally. © 2019 Wilson Ornithological Society.

abstract={Native grasslands throughout the Great Plains, USA, have undergone varying levels of fragmentation. The prairie ecosystems of Nebraska, USA, provide habitat for culturally and economically important galliforms, including greater prairie-chicken (GRPC; Tympanuchus cupido pinnatus) and plains sharp-tailed grouse (STGR; Tympanuchus phasianellus jamesi). The Sandhills region in north-central Nebraska remains largely intact as grasslands, but cropland development at the margins has provided potential for alternative winter forage sites. Our objectives were to describe intraspecific seasonal shifts and interspecific differences in landscape use of these 2 species of prairie grouse in the Sandhills. We captured and radiomarked 87 birds (68 STGR, 19 GRPC) during 2015–2016 and used aerial telemetry to collect location data on birds. We used presence-only location data and ecological and anthropogenic variables (e.g., land-cover types, topography, vegetation productivity, and roads) in a maximum entropy (using MaxEnt software) approach to construct and compare seasonal species distribution models. During the breeding season, GRPC distribution probabilities were greater in areas more distant from center-pivot irrigation locations, proximate to wet meadows, and at moderate distances from crop fields, whereas during the nonbreeding season, distributions were positively influenced by conifer and mixed-grass (generally areas on peripheries of wetlands or meadows) land-cover types. For STGR during both seasons, distribution probabilities were greatest in areas more distant from wet meadows, whereas during the nonbreeding season the probabilities were also greater in areas more distant from sandy ecological sites. Using an ecological-niche-similarity approach to examine interspecific use of the landscape, we found evidence that landscape use on our study area differed between species during the breeding season, but not during the nonbreeding season. Our results provide support for coordinated, landscape-level management of galliforms, which can now be extended to seasonal priorities during management decisions on publicly and privately managed lands. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © 2019 The Wildlife Society},

abstract={Despite the acknowledged importance of prescribed fire in creating northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) breeding cover, little research has investigated bobwhite breeding season habitat selection relative to time since fire. In 2016 and 2017, we monitored radio-tagged bobwhite on a 17,000-ha portion of a military installation managed with frequent (every ~3 years) prescribed fires, applied during the growing and dormant seasons. We monitored bobwhite to determine which vegetation characteristics associated with prescribed burning were important to bobwhite breeding season habitat selection at the microsite (i.e., telemetry location compared to nearby random location) and the macrosite scale (i.e., the burn-unit containing the location compared to study area availability). During 2 breeding seasons, we collected 2,315 bobwhite locations and compared percent cover of vegetation, days since burn, basal area, and distance to key landscape features (e.g., stream, wildlife opening) at a subset of microsite locations (301 locations during 2016 and 890 locations during 2017) to paired random locations. At the microsite scale, bobwhite selected lower basal area of hardwoods, greater woody understory cover, greater other (not wiregrass [Aristida stricta]) grass cover, and greater forb cover than at random points. At the macrosite scale, bobwhite selected units with &lt;4.6 m2/ha basal area (combined hardwoods and pines) in 2016 and units with &lt;9.2 m2/ha basal area in 2017. At the macrosite scale, bobwhite selected for areas burned in the dormant season of the same year, avoided areas burned in the growing season of the same year, and used other times since last burn categories proportionate to their availability. The selection for a low basal area at both scales indicates prescribed fire effects would be limited by shading from dense overstory, and the shrubs, grasses, and forbs that provide essential cover for bobwhite during the breeding season will not develop. In lower productivity soil regions similar to our study area, we advise that thinning operations set target basal areas below 10 m2/ha to create and maintain breeding season habitat for northern bobwhite. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © 2019 The Wildlife Society},

abstract={Most seasonally migrating songbirds exhibit protandry, whereby males arrive to breeding sites in the spring before females. The proximate behavioral mechanisms of protandry are largely unknown for most species, but could include earlier migratory departure from wintering sites by males or overall faster migration by males. Using onset and intensity of migratory restlessness as proxies for departure timing and rate of migration, respectively, we evaluated these 2 hypothesized mechanisms in a Nearctic-Neotropical migrating songbird, the Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens). Birds were captured during fall migration, held in captivity over winter, and photostimulated in the spring to induce migratory behavior. Video analysis was used to separately quantify stereotypical nocturnal wing whirring and jumping migratory restlessness behaviors. The birds were then radio-tagged and released in mid-May to compare stopover duration between the sexes and validate migratory restlessness in captivity as a proxy for the motivation to migrate in the field. In captivity males initiated migratory restlessness earlier in the spring than females, demonstrating innate differences in the onset of spring migration in this species. Males also displayed higher-intensity wing whirring behavior, suggesting potential sex differences in flight behavior that could influence migration rate. We found no sex differences in stopover duration in the field following release. However, stopover duration was negatively correlated with total migratory restlessness intensity on the last night the birds were held in captivity, which supports migratory restlessness as a proxy for the motivation to migrate at the individual level. © 2019 American Ornithological Society.

abstract={Telemetry devices are widely used in avian research, but the degree to which the deployment of such devices affects the survival of study subjects is often not addressed. It is generally assumed that such effects are less pronounced in large-bodied species that conduct relatively short migrations and carry relatively light telemetry devices. We studied Bristle-thighed Curlews Numenius tahitiensis over the period 2012–2017 at a nonbreeding site on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. We used leg-loop harnesses to equip 11 curlews with externally mounted, solar-powered satellite transmitters that constituted ca. 3% of their body mass, and compared the annual survival of these birds to 37 curlews marked only with uniquely engraved leg flags. Despite the species’ large size and the small mass of the transmitters, we documented potential negative effects of externally mounted transmitters on the survival of Bristle-thighed Curlews. We also documented apparent effects of age and sex on the survival of curlews, underscoring the difficulty of disentangling the effects of research techniques on study subjects. Understanding and publicizing the potential effects of research itself on wildlife are crucial steps in the process of refining technical applications and improving the welfare of study animals. We urge researchers to critically assess and report the effects of similar research techniques to minimize deleterious effects in future studies. © 2019, International Wader Study Group.

abstract={Wildlife conservation is often improved by understanding the movement ecology of species and adapting management strategies to dynamic conditions associated with movement. Despite a remarkable recovery over the past 30 years, the establishment of self-sustaining populations of California Condors (Gymnogyps californianus) has been challenging in the human-dominated landscapes of southern California. Among these challenges are those imposed by condor ground-foraging behavior that exposes them to environmental contamination. These include lead poisoning from the ingestion of spent ammunition and micro-trash ingestion and, during takeoff and landing, collisions with human structures. We tracked 28 California Condors for 24 months with patagially mounted GPS telemetry units to investigate the characteristics of ground sites condors visited and to identify spatiotemporal trends that might aid in conservation of this critically endangered species. Ground sites occurred on a wide variety of land cover types, primarily on steep slopes, and those more frequently used were associated with open cover. Condors concentrated their visits to ground sites around a 3 h period near midday, and usage increased from winter to late summer. Our study is the first to use remotely sensed telemetry data to describe fine-scale ecological correlates of condor ground-foraging ecology and therefore has important relevance for ongoing conservation and management strategies for this species. The descriptions of ground sites we provide can be used to target conservation or management actions. © 2019 Wilson Ornithological Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Expanding gull (Laridae) populations throughout the world have been attributed to the availability of anthropogenic food subsidies. The influence of landfills on California Gull (Larus californicus) space use and the timing of their movements was evaluated in San Francisco Bay, California, USA. Using radio telemetry, 108 California Gulls were tracked, &gt; 7,000 locations were recorded, and &gt; 1 million detections were obtained at automated logger systems placed at the two main landfills and three major breeding colonies. Population home range (31-35 km 2 ) and core use areas (2-3 km 2 ) overlapped landfills and colonies, and expanded after breeding. California Gull attendance at landfills (1.6-19.0 km from colonies) increased throughout breeding and post-breeding, whereas attendance at colonies was low during pre-breeding (20%-40% per day), increased during breeding (60%-80% per day), and declined into and during post-breeding (&lt; 20% per day). California Gull attendance at landfills was greatest when garbage was delivered from 06:00 hr in the morning until 18:00 hr at night. In contrast, California Gull attendance at colonies during breeding was greater at night from 20:00 hr to 05:00 hr (50%-70% per hr) than during the day from 06:00 hr to 18:00 hr (30%-40% per hr). Landfills played a predominant role in California Gull space use and the timing of their movements in this highly urbanized estuary. © 2019 The Waterbird Society.},

abstract={Nomadism in birds is characterized by inconsistent and unpredictable migrations to breeding or nonbreeding areas often related to changing prey conditions. The Ferruginous Hawk (Buteo regalis) has been described as nomadic in studies that documented fluctuations in breeding territory occupancy and synchronous changes in prey abundance. However, documentation of tracked individuals engaged in nomadic movements is lacking and is important for evaluating population status. Between 1999 and 2014 we studied repeatability in patterns of interannual range occupancy and migration of radio-tagged, breeding adult Ferruginous Hawks (n = 33). We computed repeatability coefficients to test individual fidelity to seasonal ranges and migration paths, and timing of migrations among range-wide populations over multiple years (range = 2-6 yr). Hawks exhibited dramatic seasonal differences in annual repeatability of individual movements. During the post-breeding period in late summer, repeatability coefficients for annual range occupancy and migration path fidelity were low (r = 0.37), only 50% of hawks showed range fidelity, and hawks occupied multiple ranges (xÌ., = 1.5 ± 0.2 ranges/yr). In contrast, repeatability was moderate to high (r ≥ 0.65) in the breeding season and winter, 83% and 87% of hawks showed range fidelity to respective ranges, and hawks occupied an average of one range each season. All hawks returned to the same breeding region each year. Variation attributed to differences between individuals was significant for most migration characteristics, providing evidence for flexibility within the species for individuals to adapt to different situations and conditions, but with each individual tending to follow the same patterns over multiple years. Seasonal nomadism in Ferruginous Hawks was limited to the post-breeding period in late summer, and we found no evidence for systematic nomadism in spring migration of Ferruginous Hawks that would confound interpretation of breeding population trends. However, we recommend further telemetry studies to simultaneously document migration repeatability for this species prior to and during dramatic prey declines. © 2019 Wilson Ornithological Society.

abstract={Nomadic movements of migratory birds are difficult to study, as the scale is beyond the capabilities of hand-held telemetry (10 s of kms) but too fine-scale for long-range tracking devices like geolocators (50–100 km accuracy). Recent widespread installation of automated telemetry receiving stations allowed us, for the first time, to quantify and test predictions about within-winter movements of a presumed nomadic species, the Snow Bunting (Pletrophenax nivalis). We deployed coded radio-transmitters on 40 individual Snow Buntings during two winters (2015-16 and 2016-17) in southern Ontario, Canada, and tracked movements over a 300 by 300 km area with 69–77 active radio-receiving stations (Motus Wildlife Tracking Network). To complement our tracking data, we also examined the influence of weather on the demographics of winter flocks at a single wintering site over 6 consecutive years (n = 9312 tagged birds). We recorded movements of 25 Snow Buntings from the deployment sites to 1–6 different radio recievers (mean 2.68 locations/bird). Birds traveled a minimum average distance of 49 km between detections (range: 3 to 490 km) in the core wintering period of Dec-Feb, and cumulative total movements ranged from 3 to 740 km (average 121 ± 46 km). In March distances between detections increased to an average of 110 km, suggesting an extended early-migration period. Overall, older birds (after-second year or older) tended to move more (higher cumulative distances traveled) than younger (first winter) birds, even during the Dec-Feb period. The long-term banding data revealed that larger, male birds were more likely to be captured in colder and snowier weather, relative to female and smaller birds, suggesting that they can withstand these conditions more easily owing to their body size. We have provided the first direct-tracking data on nomadic winter movements of Snow Buntings, and tested the hypothesis that winter weather drives flock composition at a single site. Site-specific banding data suggest that weather-related changes in flock composition could explain the nomadic, landscape-scale movements of Snow Buntings we observed by using automated telemetry. Future work should explore the importance of resource availability, competition, and predation risk as drivers of winter movements in Snow Buntings. © Copyright © 2019 Mckinnon, Laplante, Love, Fraser, Mackenzie and Vézina.},

abstract={Most Neotropical migrant birds spend the majority of the annual cycle in the tropics, and the continued population declines of some species is attributed at least in part to habitat degradation and destruction on the tropical wintering grounds. Many Neotropical migrants have been observed to use a range of disturbed, agricultural, and primary forest habitats on the wintering grounds, and this habitat-use information helps us better understand the potential effects of land use in the tropics on their populations as well as to develop programs and strategies to conserve these species. Although indices and estimates of habitat-specific abundance can be informative, some wintering migrants are reported to occur in similar or even greater numbers in marginal habitats due to despotic interactions with conspecifics. Thus, investigations of habitat-specific survival and other metrics potentially related to survival are a valuable supplement, and provide a more refined indicator of habitat quality. The wood thrush is a Neotropical migrant bird that has been undergoing range-wide population declines for the past half century or more, and although their numbers appear to be greater in disturbed habitats on the wintering grounds, they are reported to experience higher survival in primary forest. We captured and tracked wintering wood thrushes with radio-telemetry in a coffee growing region in Honduras, Central America, to evaluate habitat selection in this species, as well as to determine the habitat types and microhabitat characteristics associated with survival, movement metrics, and body condition. We found that wood thrushes preferred heavily-shaded coffee over forest and open agricultural habitats, although the probability of survival and of exhibiting stationary behavior was lower in heavily-shaded coffee compared to forest, especially at higher elevations. Our findings illustrate the hazards in assuming the presence of a species in a given habitat actually reflects habitat quality, as well as the importance of conserving forest within coffee producing landscapes. © 2019},

abstract={While protected areas are a cornerstone of biodiversity conservation, human activities in these areas can negatively affect native species in direct and indirect ways. However, the potential effects of food subsidies provided by visitors on the local- and landscape-scale population dynamics of overabundant species, and how these effects may be augmented by human development outside of parks, are largely unexplored. Here, we investigated how human foods at heavily-visited sites within California parks benefited populations of Steller's jays (Cyanocitta stelleri), an overabundant predator of a threatened seabird that nests in remnant old-growth forests. Our study population was heavily subsidized with both juveniles and adults consuming substantial amounts of human foods by biomass (46% and 57%, respectively), as indicated by stable isotope analyses. Juvenile survival, adult survival, and fecundity—estimated from radio-telemetry data—were high and the population was projected to grow rapidly (25% annually). Most juveniles dispersed from parks following seasonal declines in human visitation to areas with high housing densities and more stable resources—with almost half of dispersers returning to old-growth forests the following breeding season. Thus, we found that local food subsidies at heavily-visited sites promoted source populations of jays that may bolster populations in old-growth forests at broader spatial scales, and that this effect was likely augmented by more temporally stable resources in developed areas outside of parks during the nonbreeding season. These novel results indicate that curbing populations of overabundant predators may require reductions in food subsidies both within protected areas and surrounding landscapes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Knowledge of land-use patterns that could affect animal population resiliency or vulnerability to environmental threats such as climate change is essential, yet the interactive effects of land use and climate on demography across space and time can be difficult to study. This is particularly true for migratory species, which rely on different landscapes throughout the year. Unlike most North American migratory waterfowl, populations of northern pintails (Anas acuta; hereafter pintails) have not recovered since the 1980s despite extended periods of abundant flooded wetlands (i.e. ponds). The mechanisms and drivers involved in this discrepancy remain poorly understood. While pintails are similar to other ducks in their dependence on ponds throughout their annual cycle, their extensive use of croplands for nesting differentiates them and makes them particularly vulnerable to changes in agricultural land use on prairie breeding grounds. Our intent was to quantify how changes in land use and ponds on breeding grounds have influenced pintail population dynamics by developing an integrated population model to analyse over five decades (1961–2014) of band-recovery, breeding population survey, land-use and pond count data. We focused especially on the interactive effects of pond counts and land use on pintail productivity, while accounting for density-dependent processes. Pintail populations responded more strongly to annual variation in productivity than survival. Productivity was positively correlated with pond count and negatively correlated with agricultural intensification. Further, a positive interaction between pond count and agricultural intensification was insufficient to overcome the strong negative effect of agricultural intensification on pintail productivity across nearly all pond counts. The interaction also indicated that pintail populations were more negatively impacted by the decrease in ponds associated with climate change under higher agricultural intensification. Our results indicate that pintail populations have become more vulnerable to climate change under intensified land use, which suggests that future conservation strategies must adapt to these altered relationships. The interactive effects of land use and climate on demography should be considered more frequently in animal ecology, and integrated population models provide an adaptable framework to understand vital rates and their drivers simultaneously. © 2019 The Authors.

RFID is used to track animals and to collect information about movements and other behaviors, as well as to automate or improve husbandry. Disney's Animal Kingdom® uses passive RFID technology to monitor nest usage by a breeding colony of northern carmine bee-eaters. We implemented RFID technologies in various equipment configurations, initially deploying low-frequency (LF) 125 kHz RFID and later changing to high-frequency (HF) 13.56 MHz RFID technology, to monitor breeding behavior in the flock. We installed antennas connected to RFID readers at the entrances of nest tunnels to detect RFID transponders attached to leg bands as birds entered and exited tunnels. Both LF-RFID and HF-RFID systems allowed the characterization of nest visitation, including the timing of nest activity, breeding pair formation, identification of egg-laying females, participation by nonresidents, and detection of nest disruptions. However, we collected a substantially larger volume of data using the increased bandwidth and polling speed inherent with HF-RFID, which permitted tag capture of multiple birds simultaneously and resulted in fewer missed nest visits in comparison to LF-RFID. Herein, we describe the evolution of the RFID setups used to monitor nest usage for more than 7 years, the types of data that can be gained using RFID at nests, and how we used these data to gain insights into carmine bee-eater breeding behavior and improve husbandry. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Conserving populations of species that rely on rare habitat requires that managers understand which habitat characteristics will best support population growth across multiple life stages. For songbirds, management is most often aimed at nesting adult habitat associations. However, habitat that meets adult requirements may not be similarly suited to requirements for other life stages. Henslow’s Sparrow (Centronyx henslowii) is a tallgrass prairie songbird listed as threatened or endangered in 13 states. We examined survival and habitat selection of Henslow’s Sparrow during the postfledging period. During the nesting seasons in 2015 and 2016, we attached radio transmitters to 46 nestlings in a tallgrass prairie and modeled their survival and habitat selection as a function of habitat characteristics. Thirty-five percent of fledglings survived until two weeks postfledge. Survival was negatively associated with areas of sumac (Rhus copallinum) cover, positively associated with years since last burn, and decreased as the breeding season progressed. Snakes were the most common predator of fledglings. Independent fledglings used habitat that was different than that used by adults and dependent fledglings, with habitat used during the independent period having lower litter cover and increased forb cover compared to points used during the dependent period. During the dependent period, points used by fledglings were a mean distance of 40 m (± 11 SD) from the natal nest. Following independence, points used by fledglings were 236 m (± 89 SD) from the natal nest. Henslow’s Sparrow populations may benefit from removal of encroaching sumac in tallgrass prairie, and from consideration of the varying habitats used by the species during different life stages. © 2019 by the author(s).},

abstract={Setophaga discolor (Prairie Warbler) is a Nearctic-Neotropical migratory songbird that is experiencing long-term population declines. A potentially important driver behind these decreases is the loss of shrubland and early successional forest communities in the eastern United States. Central to conservation for species like the Prairie Warbler is an understanding of breeding habitat requirements at the scale of the home range. Despite the Prairie Warbler being identified as a species of continental conservation concern, few studies have explicitly quantified habitat conditions within its home ranges. We used radio telemetry to quantify Prairie Warbler use of space during the breeding season as well as associated vegetation data across 3 study sites in north-central Pennsylvania from May to June 2016. We radio-tracked 11 adult male Prairie Warblers. Using the telemetry locations, we estimated kernel densities and classified minimum convex polygons around kernel densities to define males' home ranges and core-use areas. The average home range (95% kernel) was 6.4 ha, and the average core-use area (50% kernel) was 0.73 ha. Prairie Warbler core-use areas contained more shrubs and lower tree count than peripheral portions of home ranges. To this end, management activities that promote a dense shrub layer across early successional communities should benefit Prairie Warblers. Results from this study serve as baseline data that can be used to help direct future studies at the home-range scale of Prairie Warbler breeding-season ecology. © 2019 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

abstract={Broad-scale movements of migrant songbirds during the post-fledging period are hypothesized to aid in the development of navigational abilities, to allow individuals to prospect for future breeding territories (combined as regional exploration), or as representing the commencement of migration. Using an automated radio telemetry array, we compared broad-scale post-fledging movements of hatch-year individuals from two closely related species: blackpoll warblers Setophaga striata and myrtle warblers Setophaga coronata coronata. These two species have contrasting migratory strategies (long-distance vs short-distance), and we studied populations from two different islands in Nova Scotia that have different geographical landscape features. Locally-hatched individuals affixed with VHF radios in August were tracked throughout the Gulf of Maine region for up to 2.5 months after tagging. Departure date and direction, daily probability of initiating a flight, daily displacement, total displacement and net displacement were assessed to see if there was support for the commencement of migration or regional exploration hypotheses. We observed differences between both species and islands. Compared to blackpolls, myrtles departed later, had more variable timings and directions of departure, made fewer regional-scale flights, were more directional in their movements, and had higher net displacement. Total displacement and daily flight distances were similar between species. Variability of departure behaviour of myrtles was observed on the island farther from the mainland and both species made longer flights from that island. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that hatch-year blackpoll movements are a form of regional exploration and hatch-year myrtle movements represent the initial stages of migration. Species differences may be related to migratory strategy (long-distance vs short-distance), where the need to acquire information during post-fledging for navigational purposes is higher for blackpolls than myrtles. Island differences suggest that habitat quality and ecological barriers influence broad-scale movements, and myrtles are more facultative in their behaviour than blackpolls. © 2019 Nordic Society Oikos.

abstract={Knowledge of species-specific spatial ecology is critical for applying appropriate management strategies to maximise conservation outcomes. We used radio-telemetry to describe spatial behaviour of the critically endangered, island-endemic Mariana Crow Corvus kubaryi. To determine whether management strategies should reflect life stage, we measured the home ranges and daily movements of 22 Mariana Crows. Fledgling mobility was low during the first 31 days post-fledging and effects of age (fledgling or sub-adult) and time (months post-fledging or post-dispersal) were often driven entirely by this period. After controlling for reduced fledgling mobility, cumulative home range size increased over time for both age classes and was, on average, more than twice the area for sub-adults than fledglings. Sub-adults also tended to make longer daily movements than fledglings. Non-cumulative, monthly home range areas did not increase over time but the average overlap in home range area between consecutive months was only 63%, suggesting large shifts in space use each month. These results highlight the dynamic nature of Mariana Crow home ranges and suggest that large-scale management efforts are critical for protecting both breeding and non-breeding individuals. The application of the traditional home range concept to Mariana Crows and other wide-ranging passerine birds may result in sub-optimal management strategies. Instead, we recommend that the spatial and temporal scale of conservation efforts be informed by species-specific spatial behaviour across all relevant life stages. © 2019 BirdLife International.},

abstract={Studying the effects of urbanization on native wildlife presents an opportunity for us to learn how to design anthropogenic habitats that can best support wildlife and humans alike. In order to explore which types of suburban development best support bird diversity, a network of 16 bird feeders was installed across a university campus to compare bird diversity and community composition at locations varying in land covers such as natural forest, lawn, plantings, pavement, and buildings. Birds were observed at all feeder stations over three seasons and mist-nets were used to capture and band birds during the summer. Bird species richness, diversity, and invasive species dominance varied significantly across the feeder station sites, with higher diversity in less urbanized locations with larger areas of natural forest. Invasive House Sparrows (Passer domesticus) dominated the most urban sites and were associated with larger areas of buildings and herbaceous plantings. However, when sites with natural forest were removed from the analysis, the area of trees planted over lawn was associated with higher diversity, indicating that an increase in tree cover can support diversity in a completely developed landscape. Midscale suburban developments typically feature lawns, pavement, and landscaped plantings, but our results indicate that replacing lawns with trees, or better yet, restored forest patches, may allow us to preserve and even increase the biodiversity of our rapidly multiplying suburban landscapes. © 2019 by the author(s).},

abstract={Radio-telemetry is a commonly used scientific technique that allows researchers to collect detailed movement, habitat use, and survival data of animals; however, evidence indicates that using telemetry can affect behavior and survival. Using multiple breeding colonies and years, we investigated the effects of attached radio-transmitters on growth and survival of Forster's tern (Sterna forsteri) chicks in San Francisco Bay, California, USA, 2010–2011. We tested these potential effects at isolated islands that allowed for high re-capture rates (typically >85%) in radio-marked and banded-only chicks. Modeled Gompertz growth curves suggested that transmitters had a small negative effect on some of the asymptotic growth parameters of tern chicks; tarsus (−1.5 ± 0.7% [SE]), culmen (−1.7 ± 1.2%), and wing (−4.9 ± 2.0%) lengths were shorter for radio-marked chicks compared to banded-only chicks. In contrast, there was no difference in asymptotic mass between radio-marked chicks and banded-only chicks. Survival from hatching to fledging was lower for radio-marked chicks than banded-only chicks during 2010 (banded-only = 0.313 ± 0.162 vs. radio-marked = 0.250 ± 0.165) and 2011 (0.193 ± 0.030 vs. 0.123 ± 0.027). Most of the transmitter effect occurred within the first week after hatching, rather than in older chicks. Notably, the effect of transmitters on chick survival was primarily additive, indicating that the effect of transmitters on radio-marked chicks was not influenced by other ecological covariates. Given the effect radio-transmitters had on survival did not change across temporal or ecological gradients, transmitters can still be used to evaluate ecological factors affecting survival and timing of mortality and radio-marked birds can be used to make inferences to the general population.

abstract={The estimation of abundance is fundamental to ecology and conservation but often is difficult or impossible to accomplish reliably. Recent improvements in wildlife cameras and ecological modelling have allowed for improved accuracy in estimates of abundance. In this study, we paired nest captures and high-definition nest video camera monitoring with modelling for a novel approach to estimate survival and abundance of threatened Piping Plovers Charadrius melodus breeding on Missouri River sandbars. From 2005 to 2014, we captured individuals on nests and uniquely marked them and recaptured previously marked individuals. In 2015–2017, we resighted marked individuals using small, high-definition video cameras deployed at nests, and counted the number of marked and unmarked breeding individuals associated with nests. We estimated apparent survival and derived estimates of the abundance of breeding individuals and population growth each year using a state-space Jolly–Seber superpopulation model with the addition of a binomial band ratio model for data collected using nest video cameras. Apparent survival averaged 0.73 ± 0.03 (mean ± sd) throughout the study. The number of breeding individuals varied, with the population increasing from 2012 to 2017 following a major habitat creation event. This study provides one of the few examples of camera data being used to produce demographic parameter and abundance estimates for an avian species. The camera and modelling methods described in this study may be applicable to other avian species in which some portion of the breeding population is uniquely marked. © 2019 British Ornithologists’ Union},

abstract={Numerous studies of spring migration have discovered that environmental conditions experienced on the wintering grounds and/or during vernal migration itself can have “carry-over effects” altering timing or success of the subsequent breeding season. Few studies have evaluated whether breeding and pre-basic molt have carry-over effects on autumn migration. The aim of this study was to test the expectations that (1) at broad temporal scales carry-over effects from breeding and molt constrain migratory departure but that (2) at finer temporal scales local weather will further refine this decision. We monitored nests of Gambel’s white-crowned sparrows breeding in the low Arctic in Alaska over three years and used radio-telemetry to track autumn migratory departure. We found that reproductive timing and weather parameters, but not molt timing, contributed to variation in autumn departure from the breeding site. Birds that terminated parental care late in the summer departed from the breeding grounds late relative to other birds. Birds were more likely to leave on nights without precipitation, when barometric pressure was increasing, and when ground level south winds were prominent. We also observed that, on average, birds departed 2.5 h after sunset and shifted the hour of departure as sunset advanced over the migration season. Our findings, in conjunction with observations of migration from earlier studies, raise the possibility that global climate change may be delaying autumn migratory departure in Gambel’s white-crowned sparrows breeding in Alaska. © 2020, Deutsche Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V.},

abstract={Effective wildlife management requires a broad understanding of how forest structure and composition influence habitat use and vital rates during all aspects of species' life-cycles, however habitat characteristics may have variable importance during different life phases. Even though the ruffed grouse Bonasa umbellus is a popular game bird that has long been a focal species for management, a greater understanding of the links between forest characteristics and components of ruffed grouse reproduction would enhance managers' ability to promote the species. We monitored 45 nests belonging to 37 females during 2015-2017 in central Maine, USA, and evaluated the influence of forest characteristics on nest-site selection, nest survival and female survival while nesting. Ruffed grouse females selected nest sites with greater horizontal visual obstruction (β = 0.16 ± 0.06 85% CI) than found at other sites that were locally available to them, however this characteristic did not appear to improve nest survival or female survival while nesting. Cumulative nest success was 42.8% and daily nest survival was reduced when coarse woody debris (CWD) was present at nest sites (β =-0.41 ± 0.33 85% CI), but we found no evidence that other habitat characteristics or features of nests themselves were related to nest survival. However, reduced female survival while nesting was associated with presence of CWD (β =-1.27 ± 0.91 85% CI), greater tree basal area (β =-0.96 ± 0.81 85% CI) and greater conifer stem density (β =-0.45 ± 0.28 85% CI) at nest sites; females had a 74.4% chance of survival during the length of time required to successfully nest. Our results demonstrate the importance of forest characteristics on multiple components of species' nesting ecology, and we provided management suggestions to promote attractive ruffed grouse nesting habitat while potentially mitigating sources of nesting failure. © 2020 Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station.},

abstract={Coastal regions on the Pacific north coast of North America provide important wintering habitat for many species of sea ducks. Although winter range and habitat preferences are well described for most species, fidelity to coastal wintering sites is generally undocumented. Fidelity is an important factor necessary for understanding interactions with coastal developments and activities and corresponding management strategies. We used data from Barrow's goldeneyes (Bucephala islandica), a sea duck that winters predominantly in nearshore habitats along the Pacific north coast, to investigate inter-annual fidelity to, and intra-annual fidelity within, coastal wintering sites. Between 2006 and 2015, we marked goldeneyes on breeding, molting, and wintering sites with satellite transmitters. We retained 4,931 locations in coastal habitats from 221 goldeneyes across 4 coastal regions for our analyses. These birds demonstrated high inter-annual fidelity to coastal wintering sites; 75% of selected wintering sites were within 29 km of sites used the previous winter. Inter-annual fidelity to wintering sites was similar between sex and age classes but differed by coastal region. Goldeneyes from southcentral Alaska, USA, expressed greater inter-annual fidelity relative to birds from northern or southern British Columbia, Canada, and southeast Alaska. Goldeneyes also expressed high intra-annual fidelity within wintering sites, with 75% of individuals averaging within-season movements of ≤9 km. Intra-annual fidelity was lesser for female than male goldeneyes but did not differ between hatch-year and after-hatch-year birds. We found regional variation in intra-annual fidelity, with goldeneyes from southcentral Alaska expressing greater intra-annual fidelity compared to birds from other regions. High inter- and intra-annual winter site fidelity by Barrow's goldeneyes suggests that, at a population level, habitat use is predictable and can be used to inform risk assessment or to evaluate factors affecting habitat choice. Also, low dispersal among wintering sites suggests that recovery from population perturbations, whether caused by natural or anthropogenic events, will be protracted. © 2019 The Wildlife Society. © 2019 The Wildlife Society},

abstract={For irruptive or facultative migrants in the subfamily Carduelinae, the winter finches, seasonal movements are extensive but have been poorly described in North America. We used stable hydrogen isotope measurements of feathers (δ2Hf) collected in three regions in Ontario, Canada, during the winters of 2014–15 and 2015–16 to infer potential breeding origins of four species. We also deployed color bands to better understand migratory movements within and across winters. Values of δ2Hf differed by age, sex, and capture location both within and among species. Predicted breeding origins of wintering evening grosbeaks (Coccothraustes vespertinus) and pine grosbeaks (Pinicola enucleator) were largely from northwestern North America, suggesting a predominately west–east pattern of seasonal movements. Common redpolls (Acanthis flammea) and hoary redpolls (A. hornemanni) largely originated from the High Arctic or western Canada, suggesting predominantly north–south seasonal movements. Grosbeaks were most often recaptured or re-sighted at the same capture location between winters. Recaptures and observations of color-banded redpolls only occurred within a winter and mostly at the same capture location. Our results document the first linkages between potential breeding and wintering sites for a large number of individual winter finches during two successive winters. Observed variation in breeding origins and movement patterns suggests each species employs a different migration strategy; therefore, future research and conservation efforts might be more beneficial if directed at individual species of winter finch. © 2020, Crown.},

abstract={Responses to climate change by seabirds in the North Pacific may include range restrictions and require colonizing new habitats. To inform conservation actions supporting climate adaptations, we examined the colonization of Año Nuevo Island, a nearshore island in central California, by Cassin's Auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus). We quantified population growth, reproduction, band returns, mortality, and habitat metrics from 1995-2017 and described habitat management that facilitated colony persistence. Cassin's Auklet breeding population grew to 136 birds by 2014, despite population declines during 2005-2007 and 2016-2017 concurrent with reproductive failures and die-offs that affected Cassin's Auklets regionally. Annual productivity of this small colony was similar to larger populations in the region at 0.72 ± 0.23 SD chicks fledged per pair from 1999-2017 (n = 15 years). Band returns indicated population connectivity with the Farallon Islands, California. Annual rates of burrow damage were 14 ± 8%, with up to 30% damaged a year. Habitat management to prevent erosion damage to nesting burrows included sea lion exclusion, erosion control, and ceramic artificial burrows. Describing conditions that facilitated the colonization and growth of this Cassin's Auklet breeding site can inform actions that support other locations and multiple burrowing seabird species. © 2020 The Waterbird Society.

We used novel tracking technologies to follow 62 acorn woodpeckers (Melanerpes formicivorus), a cooperatively breeding bird, to study extra-territorial foray behavior. Both helpers and breeders engaged in extra-territorial forays routinely and often several times per day. Helpers forayed earlier in the day and invested more time when foraying to high-quality territories. Unexpectedly, breeders forayed as often and as far as helpers. Breeders from high-quality territories forayed closer to their home territories than breeders from low-quality territories, reflecting a potential trade-off between foraying and territory defense. Such a routine pattern of extra-territorial forays in both helpers and breeders suggests that the motives behind forays differ by sex and social status and involve more than simply searching for dispersal opportunities. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America},

abstract={Aim: Conservation of highly mobile species often requires identifying locations or time periods of elevated vulnerability. Since both extrinsic habitat conditions and intrinsic behavioural and energetic requirements contribute to habitat use at the landscape scale, identifying spatial or temporal foci for conservation intervention requires understanding how habitat needs and distributions vary across the annual cycle. Nearshore marine birds inhabit highly dynamic systems and have widely varying habitat needs among breeding, moult and non-breeding seasons, making them a useful case study for testing the relative contributions of individual resource requirements and environmental conditions in driving annual variation in distribution patterns. Location: Northern Gulf of Mexico (USA). Methods: We tracked Brown Pelicans using bird-borne GPS transmitters and used a combination of Hidden Markov Models and multivariate selectivity analysis to compare the characteristics of preferred resident habitats used throughout the annual cycle. Results: Habitat selection was driven by dynamic oceanographic variables during all stages of the annual cycle. Key habitat characteristics varied between seasons, with particularly strong selection on high productivity, low temperature and low salinity during the breeding and post-breeding moult periods. The post-breeding moult also corresponded to a time of limited availability of preferred habitats, resulting in extensive overlap between breeding populations from different administrative planning areas. Main conclusions: By incorporating seasonal variation in individual behaviour and resource requirements into our habitat models, we were able to identify the post-breeding moult as a period of high selectivity and restricted availability of preferred habitats for Brown Pelicans. Locations meeting preferred habitat criteria during the post-breeding period, particularly estuarine habitats with high productivity and low salinity, would therefore be high-value targets for management and restoration. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of accounting for both intrinsic and extrinsic temporal variation in evaluating habitat selection. © 2019 The Authors.

abstract={Avian research may require investigators to capture birds for many reasons, including to collect measurements and attach leg bands or transmitters. The effectiveness and efficiency of capture techniques varies by species, habitat, and time of year. Rails are particularly challenging to capture because of their secretive behavior and the dense vegetation they inhabit. As such, basic natural history questions for many rail species remain unanswered. We paired audio lures with modified noose carpets to capture and study 69 Yuma Ridgway's rails (Rallus obsoletus yumanensis) in the southwestern United States during 2016–2018. We compared results with other more commonly used capture methods, and our results show that noose carpets paired with audio lures can be an effective tool to capture rails, thereby facilitating studies of their ecology and life history. Noose carpets are easy to use, cheap to build and maintain, and effective over a wide range of conditions. This method could be used to capture rails other than the Yuma Ridgway's rail by adjusting the noose size, noose line weight, and audio lures to match the target species. Published 2020.

abstract={Wildlife biologists commonly use marked individuals to estimate population size and vital rates. If markers are lost or become too illegible to be reported (which we define as functional loss), population size and vital rates derived from marked individuals could be biased. We double-banded 4,990 lesser scaup (Aythya affinis) and 1,429 redheads (A. americana) with a traditionally used band made of aluminum, plus another band made of incoloy designed to be more resistant to wear. Banding took place at 10 late-summer banding stations in the northcentral United States and Canada during 2009 and 2010 and during spring at Pool 19 on the Mississippi River, Iowa, USA, during 2009–2011. We then examined bands recovered from hunter-shot birds to assess wear of paired bands. We also conducted band-recovery analyses to test for differences in band retention and reporting rates between birds banded with aluminum versus hard metal bands. Band wear assessments indicated that incoloy bands lost zero mass over time and showed no effects of wear. Although no bands were lost, aluminum bands showed significant mass loss and wear over time. For double-banded lesser scaup recovered in their fourth year after banding, 71.9% of aluminum bands had contact information that was completely unreadable, compared with only 12.5% for those worn by redheads. Based on our recent double-band recovery data, up to 34% of lesser scaup bands would be recovered during the fifth through eighth hunting seasons of band wear. Band wear affected estimated recovery rates of both species, with stronger effects in lesser scaup. Our results indicate that use of aluminum bands resulted in a substantial loss of information; thus, banders should only use bands made of hard metal alloys (e.g., incoloy or stainless steel), and discontinue all use of aluminum bands for these species and other diving ducks with sparse recovery data. Future demographic analyses using banding data for species with excessive band wear and low numbers of band-recoveries should account for band type and functional band loss. © 2020 The Wildlife Society. © 2020 The Wildlife Society},

abstract={Determining the source areas of harvested individuals is important for effective conservation and management of migratory game birds. Banding has provided much information about source areas, but obtaining samples of marked individuals representative of all potential breeding areas is difficult for most species. To add to previous knowledge of harvest derivation based on banding data and to assist with regulatory decisions, we used stable hydrogen isotope (δ2H) techniques to estimate natal and molt source areas of Blue-winged Teal (Spatula discors) harvested in southern Canada in 2014 and 2017. We found that most birds harvested in southern Saskatchewan, southern Manitoba, northern Ontario, and southern Ontario likely originated in the prairie and boreal plains regions of Canada and the United States, which is the core production area for the species. Based on feather δ2H values, some birds harvested in Ontario may have also originated in Ontario. Our results differ from those of a long-term analysis of band recovery data that revealed that most Blue-winged Teal harvested in Ontario originated in the eastern part of the province and areas along the lower Great Lakes and southwestern Quebec. We found that nearly all birds harvested in Ontario in our study likely originated from areas north and west of the province. Together, banding and stable isotopes likely provide the best information available on source areas of harvested birds for regulatory decision making. © 2020 Association of Field Ornithologists},

abstract={An animal's movement is expected to be governed by an interplay between goals determined by its internal state and energetic costs associated with navigating through the external environment. Understanding this ecological process is challenging when an animal moves in two dimensions and even more difficult for birds that move in a third dimension. To understand the dynamic interaction between the internal state of an animal and the variable external environment, we evaluated hypotheses explaining association of different covariates of movement and the trade-offs birds face as they make behavioural decisions in a fluctuating landscape. We used ~870 000 GPS telemetry data points collected from 68 Golden Eagles Aquila chrysaetos to test demographic, diel, topographic and meteorological hypotheses to determine (1) the probability that these birds would be in motion and (2), once in motion, their flight speed. A complex and sometimes interacting set of potential internal and external factors determined movement behaviour. There was good evidence that reproductive state, manifested as age, sex and seasonal effects, had a significant influence on the probability of being in motion and, to a lesser extent, on speed of motion. Likewise, movement responses to the external environment were often unexpectedly strong. These responses, to northness of slope, strength of orographic updraft and intensity of solar radiation, were regionally and temporally variable. In contrast to previous work showing the role of a single environmental factor in determining movement decisions, our analyses support the hypothesis that multiple factors simultaneously interact to influence animal movement. In particular they highlighted how movement is influenced by the interaction between the individual's internal reproductive state and the external environment, and that, of the environmental factors, topographic influences are often more relevant than meteorological influences in determining patterns of flight behaviour. Further disentangling of how these internal and externals states jointly affect movement will provide additional insights into the energetic costs of movement and benefits associated with achieving process-driven goals.

abstract={Small scanning radars have been used for many years to track the movements of insects, birds and bats. While the ability to track multiple flying animals simultaneously has numerous applications in basic ecology and applied conservation, translating radar tracks into accurate animal densities and fluxes requires estimates of detection and tracking probabilities. These can be challenging to determine, especially in environments with variable background clutter. In order to assess radar tracking probabilities, we added echoes from simulated bird tracks to sequences of scans collected with an X-band marine radar at a colony of common and roseate terns (Sterna hirundo and S. dougallii) on Great Gull Island, New York, USA in the summers of 2014 and 2015. Automated detection, classification and tracking algorithms were used to extract the trajectories of terns from the radar data. The proportion of simulated tracks recovered by these procedures could then be used to estimate the tracking probabilities for real birds. Stationary telescope transects provided visual ground truth. The radar could track individual birds up to 3 km away, performing best between 0.5 and 1.2 km, where 38% of simulated birds were correctly detected and tracked in each scan. Overall, 94% of all simulated birds were tracked over at least part of their trajectories. Tracking performance was limited by weak bird echoes, backscatter from the sea surface and the inherent challenges of multi-target tracking. This simulation-based method provides a low-cost, flexible approach for estimating radar-tracking probabilities in complex, cluttered environments. Knowledge of these probabilities in turn allows the animal densities and fluxes to be corrected for imperfect detection. Despite their limitations, small scanning radars can track hundreds of birds simultaneously over tens of km2, giving a view of animal movement unavailable with other techniques. © 2020 British Ecological Society},

abstract={Breeding success should increase with prior knowledge of the surrounding environment, which is dependent upon an animal's ability to evaluate habitat. Prospecting for nesting locations and migratory stopover sites are well-established behaviours among bird species. We assessed whether three species of California dabbling ducks – mallards, Anas platyrhynchos, gadwall, Mareca strepera, and cinnamon teal, Spatula cyanoptera – in Suisun Marsh, California, U.S.A., a brackish marsh, prospect for suitable wetlands in the week prior to brooding. K-means cluster analyses grouped 29 mallard and gadwall hens into three groups. One group (N = 13) demonstrated evidence of brood site prospecting, with the fewest and latest prebrooding wetland visits. Of these hens, seven visited their future brood pond an average of 1.14 times and only shortly before brooding (1.29 days), obtaining current information on habitat suitability. For the remaining six hens, we did not detect a brooding wetland visit, possibly due to data limitations or because these hens acquired sufficient familiarity with the wetland habitat during nest breaks in adjacent wetlands, obviating the need to prospect the specific brood pond. The second identified group of hens (N = 11) visited the brooding wetland most frequently (on 4.55 days), further in advance (5.27 days), with the fewest unique wetland visits and the earliest brooding date (26 May). The final group of hens (N = 5) were the latest to brood (21 June) and visited the most wetlands, possibly due to less water or more broods present across the landscape. Brood ponds were always farther from the nest than the nearest ponds, indicating that habitat suitability or presence of conspecifics is more important to brood site selection. Prospecting provides hens with knowledge about current habitat conditions and allows them to ‘crowdsource’ public information regarding use of that habitat by other brooding hens. Prospecting may, therefore, benefit ducks inhabiting ephemeral habitats like those within Suisun Marsh, where brood habitat is limited and water cover changes rapidly during the breeding season. © 2020},
